<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="center bold">ABRAHAM LINCOLN.</p>

<p>How American history would dwindle if
that name were taken out of it! Washington
was great. Grant was great. Lee
was great. Many others have been and
are great in all the walks of life. But
Lincoln, who came out of the lowly heart
of the people, will come back nearer to
that heart than any other man probably
that the nation has known. There have
been men of war and there have been men
of peace, but there has been no such man
of peace in war as Lincoln.</p>

<p>Why is it we never tire of thinking of
Mr. Lincoln personally, nor of speaking
of him and his deeds? Is it not because
“he was indeed one of the most unique
figures in history, and one of the most remarkable
surprises of the age?” What
has he been called by those who knew him
best? “The greatest of patriots, the wisest
of rulers, the ablest of men.”</p>

<p>What led to his greatness and caused
him to hold such an extraordinary sway
over the people during the most tumultuous
of times, when seven states had
seceded and the rebellion was well under
way at his inauguration, and when a
bloody and fiercely contested war was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
fought during his administration? I will
let one more competent than myself
answer. Bishop Fowler, of the First M.
E. Church of New York, said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What, then, were the elements of Lincoln’s
greatness? To begin with, ‘he was
not made out of any fool mud,’ and then
he thoroughly understood himself and
knew how to handle his resources. His
moral sense was the first important trait
of his character, his reason the second, and
the third was his wonderful ‘common-sense,’
the most uncommon thing found
even among the great.</p>

<p>“These are the three fixed points on which
his character hung. Without the first he
had been a villain. Without the second, a
fool. Without the third, a dreamer. With
them all he made up himself&mdash;Abraham
Lincoln.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is wonderful how many stories President
Lincoln told, and still more wonderful
how many stories are told of him.
The late Senator Voorhees, of Indiana,
said that Lincoln had more stories than
any other man he had ever met. He had
a story for every occasion, and he illustrated
everything by anecdote. Some of
the best stories current to-day originated
with Lincoln and hundreds of his best
stories have never been published. Senator
Voorhees had preserved a number
which he expected to use in lectures
which he was preparing at the time he
died. He had hoped to live long enough
after his retirement from public life to
write a book on his personal recollections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
of the martyred President, among which
would have been included many stories.</p>

<p>The late David Davis, of Illinois, before
whose court Lincoln practiced so
often, once said that there were but three
men in the world who thoroughly understood
Abraham Lincoln&mdash;himself, Leonard
Swett, of Chicago, and Daniel W. Voorhees.
All these three men are dead.</p>

<p>In gathering material for this work the
editor has exercised due care in accepting
only such stories as bore the impress of
truth. It is his hope that this little volume
will be eagerly welcomed in every
home which venerates the name of Abraham
Lincoln, and that it will be an inspiration
to every boy of the land who, in
looking to Lincoln for an ideal, should
ever remember that</p>

<h1>BEST LINCOLN STORIES TERSELY TOLD.</h1>

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_GREAT_STRENGTH">LINCOLN’S GREAT STRENGTH
AS A BOY.</h2>

<p>The strength Lincoln displayed when
he was ten years old is remarkable. At
that age he was almost constantly using an
axe in chopping and splitting wood and
he used it with great skill, sinking it
deeper into the wood than any other
person. He cut the elm and linn brush
used for feeding the stock, drove the team,
handled the old shovel-plow, wielded the
sickle, threshed wheat with a flail, fanned
and cleaned it with a sheet and performed
other labor that few men of to-day could
do so well. He wielded the axe from the
age of ten till he was twenty-three. As
he grew older he became one of the
strongest and most popular “hands” in
the vicinity and his services were in great
demand. He was employed as a “hand”
by his neighbors at 25 cents a day, which
money was paid to his father.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="WAS_PROUD_OF_HIS_STRENGTH">WAS PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH.</h2>

<p>Mr. Lincoln was a remarkably strong
man; he was strong as well as tall. He
was in the habit of measuring his height
with other tall men,&mdash;he did this even in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the White House. In 1859 he visited the
Wisconsin State Fair at Milwaukee and
was led around by the then Governor
Hoyt. They entered a tent where a
“strong man” was performing with huge
iron balls. His feats amazed and interested
Lincoln. The governor told him to go
up on the platform and be introduced to
the athlete, by whose exhibition of skill
he was so fascinated. He did so, and
after the formal introduction he remarked
to the “strong man,” who was short of
stature: “Why, I could lick salt off the
top of your hat.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLN_A_POWERFUL_WRESTLER">LINCOLN A POWERFUL WRESTLER.</h2>

<p>While a clerk in a general store at New
Salem, Ill., Lincoln gained the reputation
of being a skillful and powerful wrestler.
Near New Salem was a settlement known
as Clary’s Grove, in which lived an organization
known as “Clary’s Grove Boys.”
They were rude in their manners and
rough and boastful in their ways, being
what would to-day be called “a set of
rowdies.”</p>

<p>The leader of this organization, and the
strongest of the lot, was a young man
named Armstrong. It had been said that
Lincoln could easily outdo any one of
the Clary Grove boys in anything and the
report naturally touched the pride of the
Armstrong youth. He felt compelled to
prove the truth or falsity of such a story,
and accordingly a wrestling match was
arranged between Lincoln and himself.</p>

<p>It was a great day in the village of New
Salem and Clary’s Grove. The match was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
held on the ground in front of the store
in which Lincoln had been clerking. There
was much betting on the result, the odds
being against Lincoln. Hardly, however,
had the two wrestlers taken hold of each
other before the Armstrong youth found
that he had “met a foe worthy his steel.”
The two wrestled long and hard, each
doing his utmost to throw the other but
to no avail. Both kept their feet; neither
could throw the other. The Armstrong
youth being convinced that he could not
throw Lincoln, tried a “foul.” This resort
to dishonest means to gain an advantage
inflamed Lincoln with indignation,
and he immediately caught young
Armstrong by the throat, held him at
arm’s length and “shook him like a child.”</p>

<p>Armstrong’s friends rushed to his rescue,
and for a time it seemed as if Lincoln
would be mobbed. But he held his own
bravely and all alone, and by his daring
excited the admiration of even those whose
sympathies were with young Armstrong.
What at one time seemed to result in a
general fight resulted in a general handshake,
even “Jack” Armstrong declaring
that Lincoln was “the best fellow who ever
broke into camp.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLN_SPLIT_400_RAILS_FOR_A">LINCOLN SPLIT 400 RAILS FOR A
YARD OF BROWN JEANS.</h2>

<p>When Lincoln lived in Illinois (New
Salem) he wore trousers made of flax and
tow cut tight at the ankles and out at both
knees. Though a very poor young man he
was universally welcomed in every house
of the neighborhood. Money was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
scarce in those days that it is known that
Lincoln once split 400 rails for every
yard of brown jeans, dyed with white walnut
bark, that would be necessary to make
him a pair of trousers.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLN_AS_A_VERSE_WRITER">LINCOLN AS A VERSE WRITER.</h2>

<p>Even when he was a boy Lincoln was
sometimes called upon to write poetry.
The following are among his earliest attempts
at rhyme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Good boys who to their books apply,</div>
<div class="verse">Will all be great men by and by.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is needless to say that Lincoln himself
carried out what he wrote so well; in
other words, he “practiced what he
preached.” It was in a great measure
owing to his constant application to his
books that he afterward became a great
man.</p>

<p>The following poem Mr. Lincoln wrote
in 1844, while on a visit to the home of
his childhood:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">My childhood’s home I see again</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And sadden with the view;</div>
<div class="verse">And, still, as memory crowds my brain,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">There’s pleasure in it, too.</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, memory, thou midway world</div>
<div class="verse indent1">’Twixt earth and paradise,</div>
<div class="verse">Where things decayed and loved ones lost</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In dreamy shadows rise;</div>
<div class="verse">And, freed from all that’s earthy vile,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Seems hallowed, pure and bright,</div>
<div class="verse">Like scenes in some enchanted isle,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">All bathed in liquid light.</div>
</div>

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_QUICK_WIT_IN_HELPING_A">LINCOLN’S QUICK WIT IN HELPING A
GIRL TO SPELL A WORD.</h2>

<p>“Abe” Lincoln was always ready and
willing to help any one. Once he was in
a spelling match at school when the word
“defied” had been given out by the
teacher. It had been misspelled several
times when it came the turn of a girl
friend of Lincoln’s to spell. The pupils
were arranged on opposite sides of the
room and “Abe” was watching his friend
as she struggled with the spelling. She
began d-e-f, and stopped, being unable
to decide whether to proceed with an i or
a y. Happening to look up, she caught
sight of Abe, who was grinning. He
pointed with his index finger to his eye.
The hint was quickly understood, the word
was spelled with an i and it went through
all right.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLN_AS_A_NOTION_PEDDLER">LINCOLN AS A NOTION PEDDLER.</h2>

<p>In March, 1830, the Lincoln family
moved from Gentryville, Indiana, to near
Decatur, Illinois, their household goods
being packed in a wagon drawn by four
oxen driven by “Abe.” The winter previous
Lincoln had worked in a country
store in Gentryville and before undertaking
the journey he invested all the money he
had, some thirty dollars, in notions, such
as needles, pins, thread, buttons and other
domestic necessities. These he sold to
families along the route and made a
profit of about one hundred per cent. This
shows he had a mind for seizing hold of
opportunities for making money even
when young.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LINCOLN_SAVED_FROM_DROWNING">LINCOLN SAVED FROM DROWNING.</h2>

<p>The life of Lincoln during the time the
family lived in Kentucky appears to have
been entirely uneventful. He helped his
mother&mdash;after he was 3 years old&mdash;in the
simple household duties, went to the
district school, and played with the children
of the neighborhood. The only one
of young Lincoln’s playmates now living
is an old man nearly 100 years old named
Austin Gollaher, whose mind is bright and
clear, and who never tires of telling of the
days Lincoln and he “were little tikes and
played together.” This old man, who yet
lives in the log house in which he has always
lived, a few miles from the old Lincoln
place, tells entertaining stories about
the President’s boyhood.</p>

<p>Mr. Gollaher says that they were together
more than the other boys in school,
that he became fond of his little friend, and
he believed that Abe thought a great deal
of him.</p>

<p>In speaking of various events of minor
importance in their boyhood days Mr. Gollaher
remarked: “I once saved Lincoln’s
life.” Upon being urged to tell of the
occurrence he thus related it: “We had
been going to school together one year;
but the next year we had no school, because
there were so few scholars to attend,
there being only about twenty in the
school the year before.</p>

<p>“Consequently Abe and I had not much
to do; but, as we did not go to school and
our mothers were strict with us, we did
not get to see each other very often. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Sunday morning my mother waked me up
early, saying she was going to see Mrs.
Lincoln, and that I could go along. Glad
of the chance, I was soon dressed and
ready to go. After my mother and I got
there Abe and I played all through the
day.</p>

<p>“While we were wandering up and down
the little stream called Knob Creek Abe
said: ‘Right up there’&mdash;pointing to the
east&mdash;‘we saw a covey of partridges yesterday.
Let’s go over and get some of
them.’ The stream was swollen and was
too wide for us to jump across. Finally
we saw a narrow foot-log, and we concluded
to try it. It was narrow, but Abe
said, ‘Let’s coon it.’</p>

<p>“I went first and reached the other side
all right. Abe went about half-way across,
when he got scared and began trembling.
I hollered to him, ‘Don’t look down nor
up nor sideways, but look right at me and
hold on tight!’ But he fell off into the
creek, and, as the water was about seven
or eight feet deep and I could not swim,
and neither could Abe, I knew it would do
no good for me to go in after him.</p>

<p>“So I got a stick&mdash;a long water sprout&mdash;and
held it out to him. He came up, grabbing
with both hands, and I put the stick
into his hands. He clung to it, and I
pulled him out on the bank, almost dead.
I got him by the arms and shook him well,
and then rolled him on the ground, when
the water poured out of his mouth.</p>

<p>“He was all right very soon. We promised
each other that we would never tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
anybody about it, and never did for years.
I never told any one of it until after Lincoln
was killed.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_YOUTHFUL_ELOQUENCE">LINCOLN’S YOUTHFUL ELOQUENCE.</h2>

<p>One man in Gentryville, Ind., a Mr.
Jones, the storekeeper, took a Louisville
paper, and here Lincoln went regularly
to read and discuss its contents. All the
men and boys of the neighborhood gathered
there, and everything which the
paper related was subjected to their
keen, shrewd common sense. It was not
long before young Lincoln became the
favorite member of the group and the
one listened to most eagerly. Politics
was warmly discussed by these Gentryville
citizens, and it may be that sitting
on the counter of Jones’ grocery Lincoln
even discussed slavery. It certainly
was one of the live questions of Indiana
at that date.</p>

<p>Young Lincoln was not only winning
in those days in the Jones grocery store
a reputation as a debater and story teller,
but he was becoming known as a kind
of backwoods orator. He could repeat
with effect all the poems and speeches
in his various school readers, he could
imitate to perfection the wandering
preachers who came to Gentryville, and
he could make a political speech so stirring
that he drew a crowd about him
every time he mounted a stump. The
applause he won was sweet, and frequently
he indulged his gifts when he
ought to have been at work&mdash;so thought
his employers and Thomas, his father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
It was trying, no doubt, to the hard
pushed farmers to see the men who
ought to have been cutting grass or
chopping wood throw down their sickles
or axes to group around a boy whenever
he mounted a stump to develop a pet
theory or repeat with variations yesterday’s
sermon. In his fondness for speech-making
he attended all the trials of the
neighborhood and frequently walked 15
miles to Booneville to attend court.</p>

<h2 id="ONE_OF_LINCOLNS_SONGS">ONE OF LINCOLN’S SONGS.</h2>

<p>As will be learned elsewhere in this
book Annie Rutledge was Lincoln’s first
love. Mrs. William Prewitt, of Fairfield,
Iowa, is a sister of Annie Rutledge. She
is a widow in comfortable circumstances
and lives with one of her sons. This is
what she says of her dead sister and Lincoln:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Her death made a great impression upon
him I could see. We never knew him to
jolly or laugh afterward. Annie was next
to the oldest girl in our family, and she
had a great deal of the housework to do.
I remember seeing her washing in the old-fashioned
way. She would sweep and
bake, and was a good cook and took pride
in her housework. She and Abe were
very jolly together sometimes. They used
to sing together. There was one song I
didn’t like to hear, and he would sing it
to tease me. He would tip back his chair
and roar it out at the top of his voice, over
and over again, just for fun. I have the
book they used to sing out of yet with that
song in it.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>The book is an old-fashioned “Missouri
Harmony,” and the song is as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">When in death I shall calmly recline,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">O, bear my heart to my mistress dear;</div>
<div class="verse">Tell her it lived on smiles and wine</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Of brightest hue while it lingered here;</div>
<div class="verse">Bid her not shed one tear of sorrow</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To sully a heart so brilliant and bright,</div>
<div class="verse">But healing drops of the red grape borrow</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To bathe the relick from morn till night.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When informed that the song was a
queer one to sing for fun, Mrs. Prewitt replied
that “it is a queer song anyhow.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_FIRST_POLITICAL_SPEECH">LINCOLN’S FIRST POLITICAL SPEECH.</h2>

<p>A citizen of Buffalo has found among
his papers an account of the circumstances
under which Abraham Lincoln made his
maiden speech. It was originally printed
in the Springfield (Ill.) Republican, and
is as follows:</p>

<p>“The President of the United States
made his maiden speech in Sangamon
County, at Pappsville (or Richland), in
the year 1832. He was then a Whig and
a candidate for the Legislature of this
State. The speech is sharp and sensible.
To understand why it was so short the
following facts will show: 1. Mr. Lincoln
was a young man of 23 years of age and
timid. 2. His friends and opponents in the
joint discussion had rolled the sun nearly
down. Lincoln saw it was not the proper
time then to discuss the question fully, and
hence he cut his remarks short. Probably
the other candidates had exhausted the
subjects under discussion. The time, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to W. H. Herndon’s informant&mdash;who
has kindly furnished this valuable
reminiscence for us&mdash;was 1832; it may have
been 1831. The President lived at the
time with James A. Herndon, at Salem,
Sangamon County, who heard the speech,
talked about it, and knows the report to
be correct. The speech, which was characteristic
of the man, was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘Gentlemen, Fellow-Citizens: I presume
you all know who I am. I am humble
Abraham Lincoln. I have been solicited
by my friends to become a candidate
for the Legislature. My politics are short
and sweet, like an “old woman’s dance.”
I am in favor of a national bank. I am in
favor of the international improvement
system and a high protective tariff. These
are my sentiments and political principles.
If elected, I will be thankful. If defeated,
it will be all the same.’”</p>

</div>

<hr />

<h2 id="HOW_LINCOLN_BECAME_KNOWN_AS">HOW LINCOLN BECAME KNOWN AS
“HONEST ABE.”</h2>

<p>As a grocery clerk at New Salem Lincoln
was scrupulously honest. This trait
of his soon became known, but the two
following incidents are particularly responsible
for the appellation of “Honest
Abe,” given him and by which he has been
so familiarly known. He once took six
and a quarter cents too much from a customer.
He did not say to himself, “never
mind such little things,” but walked three
miles that evening, after closing his store,
to return the money. On another occasion
he weighed out a half-pound of tea, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
supposed, it being night when he did so,
and that having been the last thing he sold
in the store before going home. On
entering in the morning he discovered a
four-ounce weight on the scales. He saw
his mistake, and shutting up shop, hurried
off to deliver the remainder of the tea.
These acts of his, as well as his thorough
honesty in other respects, soon gained for
him the now famous title of “Honest Abe.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLN_WAS_AN_OBLIGING_MAN">LINCOLN WAS AN “OBLIGING” MAN.</h2>

<p>Lincoln was always ready to help any
man, woman, child or animal. He was
naturally kindhearted, and “possessed in
an extraordinary degree the power of entering
into the interests of others, a power
found only in reflective, unselfish natures.”
He loved his friends and sympathized with
them in their troubles. He was anxious
always to do his share in making their
labors day after day as light as possible.</p>

<p>Thus we are told by his neighbors (biography
by Mr. Herndon and others) that
he cared for the children while on a visit to
a friend’s house; gave up his own bed in
the tavern where he was boarding when
the house was full, and slept on the counter;
helped farmers pull out the wheel of
their wagon when it got stuck in the mud;
chopped wood for the widows; rocked the
cradle while the woman of the house where
he was staying was busy getting the meal,
and otherwise made himself useful. No
wonder there was not a housewife in all
New Salem who would not gladly “put
on a plate” for Abe Lincoln, or who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
not darn or mend for him whenever he
needed such services. It was the “spontaneous,
unobtrusive helpfulness of the
man’s nature which endeared him to everybody.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="HOW_LINCOLN_PAID_A_LARGE_DEBT">HOW LINCOLN PAID A LARGE DEBT.</h2>

<p>Mr. Lincoln went into partnership in the
grocery business in New Salem. Ill., with
a man named Berry. This man Berry mismanaged
the business while Lincoln was
away surveying. Eventually he died, leaving
Lincoln to pay a debt of eleven
hundred dollars contracted by the firm.
In those days it was the fashion for business
men who had failed to “clear out,”
that is, skip the town and settle elsewhere.
Not so with “Abe.” He quietly settled
down among the men he owed and promised
to pay them. He asked only time.
For several years he worked to pay off
this debt, a load which he cheerfully and
manfully bore. He habitually spoke of it
to his friends as the “national debt,” it
was so heavy. As late as 1848, when he
was a member of Congress, he sent home
a part of his salary to be applied on these
obligations. All the notes, with the high
interest rates then prevailing, were finally
paid.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="HIS_FIRST_SIGHT_OF_SLAVERY">HIS FIRST SIGHT OF SLAVERY.</h2>

<p>In May, 1831, Lincoln and a few companions
went to New Orleans on a flat-boat
and remained there a month. It was
there that he witnessed for the first time
negro men and women sold like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
animals. The poor beings were chained,
whipped and scourged. “Against this inhumanity
his sense of right and justice rebelled,
and his mind and conscience were
awakened to a realization of what he had
often heard and read,” writes one of his
biographers, Ida M. Tarbell. One morning,
in his rambles with his friends over
the city, he passed a slave auction. A
comely mulatto girl of vigorous physique
was being sold. She underwent a thorough
examination at the hands of the bidders;
they pinched her flesh, and made her
trot up and down the room like a horse to
show how she moved, and in order, as the
auctioneer said, that “bidders might satisfy
themselves” whether the article they
were offering to buy was sound or not.
“The whole thing was so revolting that
Lincoln moved away from the scene with
a deep feeling of unconquerable hate.”
He remarked to his companions: “If I
ever get a chance to hit that thing
(slavery) I’ll hit it hard.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLN_AND_DAVIS_IN_THE_BLACK">LINCOLN AND DAVIS IN THE BLACK
HAWK WAR.</h2>

<p>Abraham Lincoln had a very brief experience
with actual warfare. He enlisted
with a company of volunteers to take part
in the Black Hawk war. It was the custom
in those days for each company to
elect its own Captain, and Lincoln was
chosen Captain of his company almost
unanimously. He was heard to say many
times in after life that no other success
in his life had given him such pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
as did this one. His command did little,
as they were never engaged in a pitched
battle, so Lincoln had to be content “with
the reputation of being the best comrade
and story-teller in the camp.” It is
a peculiar coincidence that Jefferson Davis
also served as an officer in this war.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_GLOWING_TRIBUTE_TO_HIS">LINCOLN’S GLOWING TRIBUTE TO HIS
MOTHER.</h2>

<p>These famous words originated with the
good and lowly Abraham Lincoln:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All that I am, or hope to be, I owe to
my angel mother.”</p>

</div>

<p>His affection for his mother was very strong,
and long after her death he would speak of her
affectionately and tearfully. She was a woman
five feet five inches in height, slender of figure,
pale of complexion, sad of expression,
and of a sensitive nature. Of a heroic nature,
she yet shrank from the rude life around
her. About two years after her removal
from Kentucky to Indiana she died.
“Abe” was then ten years old. She was
buried under a tree near the cabin home,
where little “Abe” would often betake
himself and, sitting on her lonely grave,
weep over his irreparable loss.</p>

<p>Lincoln’s mother was buried in a green
pine box made by his father. Although a
boy of ten years at that time, it was
through his efforts that a parson came all
the way from Kentucky to Indiana three
months later to preach the sermon and
conduct the service. The child could not
rest in peace till due honor had been done
his dead mother.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="WHAT_LINCOLNS_STEP-MOTHER_SAID">WHAT LINCOLN’S STEP-MOTHER SAID
OF HIM.</h2>

<p>“Abe was a good boy, and I can say
what scarcely one woman&mdash;a mother&mdash;can
say in a thousand: Abe never gave me a
cross word or look, and never refused, in
fact or appearance, to do anything I requested
him. I never gave him a cross
word in all my life. … His mind and
mine&mdash;what little I had&mdash;seemed to run together.
He was here after he was elected
President. He was a dutiful son to me always.
I think he loved me truly. I had
a son, John, who was raised with Abe.
Both were good boys; but I must say, both
now being dead, that Abe was the best
boy I ever saw, or expect to see.”&mdash;Ida M.
Tarbell.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_FIRST_LOVE">LINCOLN’S FIRST LOVE.</h2>

<p>Lincoln’s first love was Anna Rutledge,
of New Salem, whose father was keeper of
the Rutledge tavern where “Abe” boarded.
The girl had been engaged to a young
man named John McNeill, whom, we are
informed, the village community pronounced
an adventurer and a man unworthy
the girl’s love. He left for the
east, promising, however, to return within
a year and claim her as his wife, so the
story reads. According to Mrs. William
Prewitt, a sister of Anna Rutledge, who is
at present (1898) living, the engagement
was broken off before McNeill went away,
so that she was free to receive the attentions
of “Abe” Lincoln. She finally
promised to become his wife in the spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of 1835, soon after his return from Vandalia.
But, unfortunately, circumstances
did not permit of a marriage then, Lincoln
being barely able to support himself, not
yet having been admitted to the bar, and
the girl, being but seventeen years old.
It was agreed that she should attend an
academy at Jacksonville, Ill., and Lincoln
would devote himself to his law studies till
the next spring, when he would be admitted
to the bar, and then they would be
married.</p>

<p>New Salem was deeply interested in the
young lovers and prophesied a happy life
for them; but fate willed it otherwise.
Anna Rutledge became seriously ill, with
an attack of brain fever, and when it was
seen that her recovery was impossible Lincoln,
her lover, was sent for. They “passed
an hour alone in an anguished parting,”
and soon after (August 25, 1835,) Anna
died.</p>

<p>The death of his sweetheart was a terrible
blow to Lincoln. His melancholy increased
and darkened his mind and his
imagination, and tortured him with its
black picture. One stormy night he was
sitting beside a friend of his, with his head
bowed on his hand, while tears trickled
through his fingers. His friend begged
him to try to control his sorrow; to try to
forget it. Lincoln replied: “I cannot;
the thought of the snow and rain on Ann’s
grave fills me with indescribable grief.”
For many days Lincoln journeyed on foot
to the cemetery where Anna Rutledge lay
buried, and there alone, in the “city of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
dead,” wept for the girl whom he had
loved so well. Many years afterward,
when he had married and become great,
he said to a friend who questioned him:
“I really and truly loved the girl and
think often of her now.” After a pause he
added: “And I have loved the name of
Rutledge to this day.”</p>

<h2 id="THE_DUEL_LINCOLN_DIDNT_FIGHT">THE DUEL LINCOLN DIDN’T FIGHT.</h2>

<p>President Abraham Lincoln and General
Joe Shields, who married sisters, once
arranged to fight a duel at Alton, Ill. It is
remembered yet by the old settlers.
Shields had offended a young lady at
Springfield, and she got even by sending
an article about it to a Springfield paper,
signing a nom de plume. The next day
General Shields called upon the editor and
gave him 24 hours during which to divulge
the name of the author or to take
the consequences. The editor, who was
a friend of Abraham Lincoln, called upon
him and asked what to do. Not thinking
it was a very serious affair, Lincoln
promptly said, “Tell him that I wrote it.”
The editor did so, and General Shields
challenged Lincoln to a duel, the latter
accepting and choosing broadswords as
the weapons and an island opposite Alton
as the place. The principals and seconds
went to the place appointed, when a chance
remark of Lincoln that he hated to have to
kill Shields because he caused him to believe
that he wrote the article in order to
protect a lady, brought about a reconciliation,
and the duel failed to come off. Hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of people were on the bank of the
river, and to carry out a joke a log was
dressed up, placed in a skiff, the occupants
fanning it with their hats as though it was
an injured man, and the excitement was intense.
It always remained a sore spot
with Lincoln, and but little was ever said
about it.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLN_AS_A_DANCER">LINCOLN AS A DANCER.</h2>

<p>Lincoln made his first appearance in
society when he was first sent to Springfield,
Ill., as a member of the state legislature.
It was not an imposing figure
which he cut in a ballroom, but still he
was occasionally to be found there.
Miss Mary Todd, who afterward became
his wife, was the magnet which drew
the tall, awkward young man from his
den. One evening Lincoln approached
Miss Todd and said, in his peculiar
idiom:</p>

<p>“Miss Todd, I should like to dance
with you the worst way.”</p>

<p>The young woman accepted the inevitable
and hobbled around the room
with him. When she returned to her
seat, one of her companions asked mischievously:</p>

<p>“Well, Mary, did he dance with you the
worst way?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, “the very
worst.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_COURTSHIP_AND">LINCOLN’S COURTSHIP AND
MARRIAGE.</h2>

<p>In 1839 Miss Mary Todd, of Kentucky,
arrived in Springfield to visit a married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
sister, Mrs. Edwards. At the instance of
his friend Speed, who was also a Kentuckian,
Lincoln became a visitor at the
Edwards’, and before long it was apparent
to the observant among those in Springfield
that the lively young lady held him
captive. Engagements at that time and
in that neighborhood were not announced
as soon as they were made, and it is not at
all impossible that Miss Todd and Mr.
Lincoln were betrothed many months before
any other than Mrs. Edwards and Mr.
Speed knew of it.</p>

<p>At this time, as was the case till Lincoln
was elected to the presidency, his one
special rival in Illinois was Stephen A.
Douglas. Mr. Douglas had more of the
social graces than Mr. Lincoln, and it appeared
to him that nothing would be more
interesting than to cut out his political
rival in the affections of the entertaining
and lively Miss Todd, and so he paid her
court.</p>

<p>A spirited young lady from Kentucky
at that time in Illinois would have been
almost less than human if she had refused
to accept the attentions of the two leading
men of the locality. Therefore Miss Todd,
being quite human, encouraged Douglas,
and again there was what nowadays would
have been called a flirtation. This course
of action did not spur Lincoln on in his
devotion, but made him less ardent, and he
concluded, after much self worriment, to
break off the engagement, which he did,
but at the same interview there was a
reconciliation and a renewal of the engagement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Lincoln’s marriage to Mary Todd occurred
in Springfield, Ill., at the home of
Mr. M. W. Edwards, where Miss Todd
lived. She was the belle of Springfield.
The marriage, although hastily arranged
in the end, was perhaps the first one performed
in that city with all the requirements
of the Episcopal ceremony. Rev.
Charles Dresser officiated. Among the
many friends of Lincoln who were present
was Thomas C. Brown, one of the judges
of the state supreme court. He was a
blunt, outspoken man and an old timer.</p>

<p>Parson Dresser was attired in full
canonical robes and recited the service
with much impressive solemnity. He
handed Lincoln the ring, who, placing it
on the bride’s finger, repeated the church
formula, “With this ring I thee endow
with all my goods and chattels, lands
and tenements.”</p>

<p>Judge Brown, who had never before
witnessed such a ceremony, and looked
upon it as utterly absurd, ejaculated, in a
tone loud enough to be heard by all, “God
Almighty, Lincoln, the statute fixes all
that!” This unexpected interruption almost
upset the old parson, who had a keen
sense of the ridiculous, but he quickly recovered
his gravity and hastily pronounced
the couple man and wife.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_PERSONAL_APPEARANCE">LINCOLN’S PERSONAL APPEARANCE.</h2>

<p>That Lincoln was a man of extraordinary
personal appearance is well
known. He measured six feet four inches,
and as most men are below six feet it will
be seen that he was considerably taller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
than the average. He possessed great
strength, both bodily and mental, and had
a superabundance of patience, which he
displayed constantly, and treated even
those who differed with him with respect
and kindness. One who had sustained
close relations with Lincoln and knew him
intimately, the late Charles A. Dana, in
his Reminiscences of Abraham Lincoln,
published in McClure’s Magazine, thus describes
him:</p>

<p>“Mr. Lincoln’s face was thin, and his
features were large. He had black hair,
heavy eyebrows, and a square and well
developed forehead. His complexion was
dark and quite sallow. He had a smile
that was most lovely, surpassing even a
woman’s smile in its engaging quality.
When pleased his face would light up
very pleasantly. Some have said he was
awkward in his step. The word ‘awkward’
hardly fits, because there was such
a charm and beauty about his expression,
such good humor and friendly spirit looking
from his eyes, that one looking at
him never thought whether he was awkward
or graceful. His whole personality
at once caused you to think, ‘What a
kindly character this man has!’ Always
dignified in manner, he was benevolent
and benignant, always wishing to do
somebody some good if he could. He
was all solid, hard, keen intelligence combined
with goodness.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_MOTHER">LINCOLNS’ MOTHER.</h2>

<p>Not long before his tragic death, Mr.
Lincoln said: “All that I am, and all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
I hope to be, I owe to my mother.” That
mother died when little Abe was nine
years of age. But she had already woven
the texture of her deepest character into
the habits and purposes of her boy. Her
own origin had been humble. But there
were certain elements in her character that
prepared her for grand motherhood.
When Nancy Hanks, at the age of twenty-three,
gave her heart and hand to Thomas
Lincoln, she was a young woman of
large trustfulness, of loving, unselfish disposition,
of profound faith in Divine Providence,
of unswerving Christian profession.</p>

<p>On the day of their marriage Thomas
Lincoln took this young wife to his unfinished
cabin, which had as yet neither
door, floor, nor window. The young man
was a shiftless Kentucky hunter, who
could not read a word. He was handy
with his few carpenter tools, but had received
no encouragement to keep at work.
His happy, trusting wife assisted him to
finish the cabin. He mortared the chinks
with mud which they together had mixed.
Her hope and song made the work of the
day his happy employ. In the evening
she taught him to read, spelling the words
out of her Bible as the text book, which
served her double purpose.</p>

<p>From that day Thomas Lincoln was a
new man. It was this conscientious wife
that inspired him to move across the Ohio
into the free State of Indiana. Here Lincoln
soon became a justice of the peace.
When this wife died, only twelve years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
after their marriage, Thomas Lincoln had
been transformed from the shiftless hunter,
who could not read, to an intelligent
farmer of the largest influence of any man
in his township. Little Abe had been
taught to read out of that same Bible, and
had read out of that mother’s eyes and
voice her large trust in the overshadowing
Providence and her unswerving honesty
in doing the right. It was this woman
that put into his hands the fine books&mdash;the
Bible, Pilgrim’s Progress, Æsop’s
Fables, Robinson Crusoe, and Weems’s
Life of Washington.</p>

<p>Such was the mother that started Abraham
Lincoln. “Widow Johnston,” who
became his stepmother, was a good woman,
with whom he always maintained
the kindest relations. She deserved the
honorable mention she received.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_MELANCHOLIA">LINCOLN’S MELANCHOLIA.</h2>

<p>A friend of Lincoln writes: Lincoln’s
periods of melancholy are proverbial. On
one occasion, while in court in 1855, Maj.
H. C. Whitney describes him as “sitting
alone in one corner of the room remote
from any one else, wrapped in abstraction
and gloom. It was a sad but interesting
study for me, and I watched him for some
time. It appeared as if he were pursuing
in his mind some sad subject through
various sinuosities, and his face would assume
at times the deepest phases of seeming
pain, but no relief came from this
dark and despairing melancholy till he
was roused by the breaking up of court,
when he emerged from his cave of gloom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and came back, like one awakened from
sleep, to the world in which he lived
again.” As early as 1837 Robert L. Wilson,
who was his colleague in the legislature,
testifies that Lincoln admitted to
him that, although he appeared to enjoy
life rapturously, still he was the victim
of extreme melancholy, and that he was so
overcome at times by depression of spirits
that he never dared carry a pocketknife.</p>

<p>To physicians he was something of a
physiological puzzle. John T. Stuart insisted
that his digestion was organically
defective, so that the pores of his skin
oftentimes performed the functions of the
bowels; that his liver operated abnormally
and failed to secrete bile, and that these
things themselves were sufficient in his
opinion to produce the deepest mental depression
and melancholy.</p>

<p>Lincoln’s law partner, Mr. Herndon, attributed
Lincoln’s melancholy to the death
of Anna Rutledge, believing that his grief
at her untimely death was so intense that
it cast a perpetual shadow over his mental
horizon. Another believed that it arose
from his domestic environments; that his
family relations were far from pleasant,
and that that unhappy feature of his life
was a constant menace to his peace and
perfect equipoise of spirits. “Although
married,” says one, “he was not mated, so
that if we see him come into his office in
the morning eating cheese and bologna
sausages philosophically, what can we expect
but some periods of sadness and
gloom? Emerson, who you and I hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in high esteem, had pie for breakfast all
his married life, and in my opinion that
is what clouded his memory the rest of his
life after seventy years of age.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_HEIGHT">LINCOLN’S HEIGHT.</h2>

<p>Emma Gurley Adams in the New York
Press.</p>

<p>Sir:&mdash;The admirable speech of Hon.
Thomas B. Reed in your paper of Feb. 9
contains one error which I would like to
correct. Mr. Reed says Mr. Lincoln was
six feet four inches in height. Mr. Lincoln
told my father that he was exactly
six feet three inches only a short time before
his tragic death. Mr. Lincoln was
very fond of tall men, and generally knew
their exact height and never hesitated to
say: “I am exactly six feet three.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="HOW_LINCOLN_BECAME_A_LAWYER">HOW LINCOLN BECAME A LAWYER.</h2>

<p>That Lincoln was a skilled lawyer is
well known. It is not, however, generally
known that he learned law himself, never
having studied with anyone, or having attended
any law school. He was preëminently
a self-educated man. He borrowed
law books of his friend Stuart, of
Springfield, Ill., took them home (twenty
miles away) and studied them hard. He
walked all the way to Springfield and
back, and usually read while walking. He
often read aloud during these trips.
Twenty years afterward, while he was a
great lawyer and statesman, he gave this
advice to a young man who asked him
“how he could become a great lawyer.”
“Get books, and read and study them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
carefully. Begin with Blackstone’s ‘Commentaries,’
and after reading carefully
through, say twice, take up Chitty’s ‘Pleadings,’
Greenleaf’s ‘Evidence,’ and Story’s
‘Equity,’ in succession. Work, work, work
is the main thing.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLN_AS_A_LAWYER">LINCOLN AS A LAWYER.</h2>

<p>When Lincoln became a lawyer, he
carried to the bar his habitual honesty.
His associates were often surprised by his
utter disregard of self-interest, while they
could but admire his conscientious defense
of what he considered right. One
day a stranger called to secure his services.</p>

<p>“State your case,” said Lincoln.</p>

<p>A history of the case was given, when
Lincoln astonished him by saying:</p>

<p>“I cannot serve you; for you are wrong,
and the other party is right.”</p>

<p>“That is none of your business, if I
hire and pay you for taking the case,” retorted
the man.</p>

<p>“Not my business!” exclaimed Lincoln.
“My business is never to defend wrong, if
I am a lawyer. I never undertake a case
that is manifestly wrong.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can make trouble for the
fellow,” added the applicant.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Lincoln, fully aroused,
“there is no doubt but that I can gain
the case for you, and set a whole neighborhood
at loggerhead. I can distress a
widowed mother and her six fatherless
children, and thereby get for you six
hundred dollars, which rightly belongs as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
much to the woman and her children as it
does to you; but I won’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Not for any amount of pay?” continued
the stranger.</p>

<p>“Not for all you are worth,” replied Lincoln.
“You must remember that some
things which are legally right are not
morally right. I shall not take your
case.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care a snap whether you do or
not!” exclaimed the man angrily, starting
to go.</p>

<p>“I will give you a piece of advice without
charge,” added Lincoln. “You seem
to be a sprightly, energetic man; I would
advise you to make six hundred dollars
some other way.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_CONSCIENTIOUSNESS_IN">LINCOLN’S CONSCIENTIOUSNESS IN
TAKING CASES.</h2>

<p>Even as early as 1852 Lincoln had acquired
a reputation for story telling.
When not busy during the session of the
court he was “habitually whispering stories
to his neighbors, frequently to the annoyance
of Judge Davis, who presided over
the Eighth circuit.” If Lincoln persisted
too long the judge would rap on the chair
and exclaim: “Come, come, Mr. Lincoln;
I can’t stand this! There is no use trying
to carry on two courts. I must adjourn
mine or yours, and I think you will have
to be the one.” As soon as the group had
scattered the judge would call one of the
men to him and ask: “What was that Lincoln
was telling?”</p>

<p>In his law practice Lincoln seems to
have been singularly conscientious, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
first effort being to try to arrange matters
so as to avoid litigation. Nor would he
assume a case that he felt was not founded
upon right and justice.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="THE_JURY_UNDERSTOOD">THE JURY UNDERSTOOD.</h2>

<p>Another one of these anecdotes is related
in connection with a case involving
a bodily attack. Mr. Lincoln defended,
and told the jury that his client was in the
fix of a man who, in going along the highway
with a pitchfork over his shoulder,
was attacked by a fierce dog that ran out
at him from a farmer’s door-yard. In parrying
off the brute with the fork its prongs
stuck into him and killed him.</p>

<p>“What made you kill my dog?” said the
farmer.</p>

<p>“What made him bite me?”</p>

<p>“But why did you not go after him with
the other end of the pitchfork?”</p>

<p>“Why did he not come at me with his
other end?” At this Mr. Lincoln whirled
about in his long arms an imaginary dog
and pushed his tail end towards the jury.
This was the defensive plea of “Son assault
demesne”&mdash;loosely, that “The other
fellow brought on the fight”&mdash;quickly told
and in a way the dullest mind would grasp
and retain.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_HONESTY_WITH_A_LADY">LINCOLN’S HONESTY WITH A LADY
CLIENT.</h2>

<p>A lady who had a real estate claim which
she desired prosecuted once called on Lincoln
and wished him to take up her case.
She left the claim in his hands, together
with a check for two hundred dollars as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a retaining fee. Lincoln told her to call
the next day, and meanwhile he would examine
her claim.</p>

<p>Upon presenting herself the next day
the lady was informed that he had examined
the case carefully, and told her frankly
that she had no valid or legal grounds
on which to base her claim. He therefore
could not advise her to institute legal
proceedings. The lady was satisfied, and
thanking him, rose to leave.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Lincoln, at the same time
fumbling in his vest pocket, “here is the
check you left with me.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Lincoln, I think you have
earned that,” replied the lady.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he responded, handing it
back to her, “that would not be right.
I can’t take pay for doing my duty.”&mdash;From
Lincoln’s Stories, by J. B. McClure.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLN_WINS_A_CELEBRATED_CASE">LINCOLN WINS A CELEBRATED CASE.</h2>

<p>The son of Lincoln’s old friend and
former employer, who had loaned him
books, was charged with a murder committed
in a riot at a camp-meeting. Lincoln
volunteered for the defense.</p>

<p>A witness swore that he saw the prisoner
strike the fatal blow. It was night, but
he swore that the full moon was shining
clear, and he saw everything distinctly.
The case seemed hopeless, but Lincoln
produced an almanac, and showed that at
that hour there was no moon. “Then he
depicted the crime of perjury with such
eloquence that the false witness fled the
court house.”</p>

<p>One who heard the trial says: “It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
near night when Lincoln concluded, saying,
‘If justice was done, before the sun
set it would shine upon his client a free
man.’”</p>

<p>The court charged the jury; they returned
and brought in a verdict of “not
guilty.” The prisoner fell into his weeping
mother’s arms, says the writer, and
then turned to thank Lincoln. The latter,
looking out at the sun, said: “It is not
yet sundown, and you are free.”&mdash;From
Lincoln’s Stories, by J. B. McClure.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_SELFISHNESS">LINCOLN’S “SELFISHNESS.”</h2>

<p>Mr. Lincoln once remarked to a fellow-passenger
on the old-time mud-wagon
coach, on the corduroy road which antedated
railroads, that all men were
prompted by selfishness in doing good or
evil. His fellow-passenger was antagonizing
his position when they were passing
over a corduroy bridge that spanned a
slough. As they crossed this bridge, and
the mud-wagon was shaking like a sucker
with chills, they espied an old, razor-back
sow on the bank of the slough, making
a terrible noise because her pigs had got
into the slough and were unable to get
out and in danger of drowning. As the
old coach began to climb the hillside Mr.
Lincoln called out: “Driver, can’t you
stop just a moment?” The driver replied.
“If the other feller don’t object.” The
“other feller”&mdash;who was no less a personage
than, at that time, “Col.” E. D. Baker,
the gallant general who gave his life in
defense of old glory at Ball’s Bluff&mdash;did
not “object,” when Mr. Lincoln jumped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
out, ran back to the slough and began to
lift the little pigs out of the mud and water
and place them on the bank. When he
returned Col. Baker remarked: “Now,
Abe, where does selfishness come in in
this little episode?” “Why, bless your
soul, Ed, that was the very essence of
selfishness. I would have had no peace
of mind all day had I gone on and left
that suffering old sow worrying over those
pigs. I did it to get peace of mind, don’t
you see?”</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLN_REMOVES_A_LICENSE_ON">LINCOLN REMOVES A LICENSE ON
THEATRES.</h2>

<p>One of the most interesting anecdotes
about the beloved Lincoln is the one
quoted from Joe Jefferson’s autobiography.
Jefferson and his father were playing
at Springfield during the session of
the legislature, and, as there was no
theaters in town, had gone to the expense
of building one. Hardly had this been
done when a religious revival broke out.
The church people condemned the theater
and prevailed upon the authorities to impose
a license which was practically prohibition.</p>

<p>“In the midst of our trouble,” says Jefferson,
“a young lawyer called on the
managers. He had heard of the injustice
and offered, if they would place the matter
in his hands, to have the license taken off,
men then in vogue he remarked how much
declaring that he only desired to see fair
play, and he would accept no fee whether
he failed or succeeded. The young lawyer
began his harangue. He handled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
subject with tact, skill and humor, tracing
the history of the drama from the time
when Thespis acted in a cart to the stage
of to-day. He illustrated his speech with
a number of anecdotes and kept the council
in a roar of laughter. His good humor
prevailed and the exorbitant tax was taken
off. The young lawyer was Lincoln.”</p>

<h2 id="HOW_LINCOLN_GOT_THE_WORST_OF">HOW LINCOLN GOT THE WORST OF
A HORSE TRADE.</h2>

<p>Abraham Lincoln was fond of a good
story, and it is a well-known fact that
he often illustrated an important point in
the business at hand by resorting to his
favorite pastime. Probably one of the best
he ever told he related of himself when
he was a lawyer in Illinois. One day
Lincoln and a certain judge, who was an
intimate friend of his, were bantering each
other about horses, a favorite topic of
theirs. Finally Lincoln said:</p>

<p>“Well, look here. Judge, I’ll tell you
what I’ll do. I’ll make a horse trade with
you, only it must be upon these stipulations:
Neither party shall see the other’s
horse until it is produced here in the
court yard of the hotel, and both parties
must trade horses. If either party backs
out of the agreement, he does so under a
forfeiture of $25.”</p>

<p>“Agreed,” cried the judge, and both he
and Lincoln went in quest of their respective
animals.</p>

<p>A crowd gathered, anticipating some
fun, and when the judge returned first, the
laugh was uproarious. He led, or rather
dragged, at the end of a halter the meanest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
boniest, rib-staring quadruped&mdash;blind
in both eyes&mdash;that ever pressed turf. But
presently Lincoln came along carrying
over his shoulder a carpenter’s horse.
Then the mirth of the crowd was furious.
Lincoln solemnly set his horse down, and
silently surveyed the judge’s animal with
a comical look of infinite disgust.</p>

<p>“Well, Judge,” he finally said, “this is
the first time I ever got the worst of it
in a horse trade.”</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLN_HELPED_HIM_TO_WIN">LINCOLN HELPED HIM TO WIN.</h2>

<p>His first case at the bar will never be
forgotten by ex-Senator John C. S. Blackburn,
of Kentucky, for Abraham Lincoln
played a conspicuous part in helping the
young Kentuckian to win his suit. Lincoln
was merely an attorney, waiting for
one of his cases to be called, when the
incident occurred.</p>

<p>Ex-Senator Blackburn was but 20 years
old when he began the practice of law,
having graduated at Center College, Danville,
Ky. His first case was in the United
States court in Chicago, presided over by
Justice John McLean, then on the circuit,
says the Chicago Times-Herald. The opposing
counsel was Isaac N. Arnold, then
at the head of the Chicago bar, and subsequently
a member of congress and author
of the first biography of Lincoln. Young
Blackburn had filed a demurrer to Mr.
Arnold’s pleadings in the cause, and when
the case was reached on the calendar the
young Kentuckian was quite nervous at
having such a formidable and experienced
antagonist, while the dignity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
tribunal and the presence of a large number
of eminent lawyers in court served to
increase his timidity and embarrassment.
In truth, the stripling barrister was willing
to have any disposition made of the cause,
in order to get rid of the burden of embarrassment
and “stage fright.” He was
ready to adopt any suggestion the opposing
counsel should make.</p>

<p>Arnold made an argument in which he
criticized the demurrer in a manner that
increased the young lawyer’s confusion.
However, Blackburn knew that he had to
make some kind of an effort. He proceeded
with a few remarks, weak and bewildering,
and was about to sit down
when a tall, homely, loose-jointed man
sitting in the bar arose and addressed the
court in behalf of the position the young
Kentuckian had assumed in a feeble and
tangled argument, making the points so
clear that the court sustained the demurrer.</p>

<p>Blackburn did not know who his volunteer
friend was, and Mr. Arnold got up
and sought to rebuke the latter for attempting
to interfere in the case, which he
had nothing to do with. This volunteer
was none other than Abraham Lincoln,
and this was the first and last time the
Kentuckian ever saw the “rail-splitting
President.” In replying to Mr. Arnold’s
strictures, Mr. Lincoln said he claimed
the privilege of giving a young lawyer a
helping hand when struggling with his
first case, especially when he was pitted
against an experienced practitioner.</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLN_SETTLES_A_QUARREL_WITHOUT">LINCOLN SETTLES A QUARREL WITHOUT
GOING TO LAW.</h2>

<p>When Abe Lincoln used to be drifting
around the country practicing law in Fulton
and Menard counties, Illinois, an old
fellow met him going to Lewistown, riding
a horse which, while it was a serviceable
enough an animal, was not of the kind
to be truthfully called a fine saddler. It
was a weather-beaten nag, patient and
plodding and it toiled along with Abe&mdash;and
Abe’s books, tucked away in saddle-bags,
lay heavy on the horse’s flank.</p>

<p>“Hello, Uncle Tommy,” said Abe.
“Hello, Abe,” responded Uncle Tommy.
“I’m powerful glad to see ye, Abe, fer I’m
gwyne to have sumthin’ fer ye at Lewiston
cot, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“How’s that, Uncle Tommy?” said
Abe.</p>

<p>“Well, Jim Adams, his land runs long
o’ mine, he’s pesterin’ me a heap an’ I
got to get the law on Jim, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Tommy, you haven’t had any
fights with Jim, have you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“He’s a fair to middling neighbor,
isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Only tollable, Abe.”</p>

<p>“He’s been a neighbor of yours for a
long time, hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Nigh on to fifteen year.”</p>

<p>“Part of the time you get along all right,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I reckon we do, Abe.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, Uncle Tommy, you see
this horse of mine? He isn’t as good a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
horse as I could straddle, and I sometimes
get out of patience with him, but I
know his faults. He does fairly well as
horses go, and it might take me a long
time to get used to some other horse’s
faults. For all horses have faults. You
and Uncle Jimmy must put up with each
other as I and my horse do with one
another.”</p>

<p>“I reckon, Abe,” said Uncle Tommy, as
he bit off about four ounces of Missouri
plug. “I reckon you’re about right.”</p>

<p>And Abe Lincoln, with a smile on his
gaunt face, rode on toward Lewistown.</p>

<h2 id="A_LINCOLN_STORY_ABOUT_LITTLE_DAN">A LINCOLN STORY ABOUT LITTLE DAN
WEBSTER’S SOILED HANDS.</h2>

<p>Mr. Lincoln, on one occasion narrated
to Hon. Mr. Odell and others, with much
zest, the following story about young
Daniel Webster:</p>

<p>When quite young, at school, Daniel
was one day guilty of a gross violation of
the rules. He was detected in the act, and
called up by the teacher for punishment.
This was to be the old-fashioned “feruling”
of the hand. His hands happened to
be very dirty. Knowing this, on his way
to the teacher’s desk, he spit upon the
palm of his right hand, wiping it off upon
the side of his pantaloons.</p>

<p>“Give me your hand, sir,” said the
teacher, very sternly.</p>

<p>Out went the right hand, partly cleaned.
The teacher looked at it a moment and
said:</p>

<p>“Daniel! if you will find another hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
in this school-room as filthy as that, I will
let you off this time!”</p>

<p>Instantly from behind his back came the
left hand. “Here it is, sir,” was the ready
reply.</p>

<p>“That will do,” said the teacher, “for
this time; you can take your seat, sir.”&mdash;From
Lincoln’s Stories, by J. B. McClure.</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_LONG_LIMBS_DRIVE_A_MAN">LINCOLN’S LONG LIMBS DRIVE A MAN
OUT OF HIS BERTH.</h2>

<p>There was one story of his career that
the late George M. Pullman told with manifest
delight, which is thus related by an
intimate friend.</p>

<p>One night going out of Chicago, a long,
lean, ugly man, with a wart on his cheek,
came into the depot. He paid George M.
Pullman 50 cents, and half a berth was
assigned him. Then he took off his coat
and vest and hung them up, and they
fitted the peg about as well as they fitted
him. Then he kicked off his boots, which
were of surprising length, turned into the
berth, and, having an easy conscience, was
sleeping like a healthy baby before the
car left the depot. Along came another
passenger and paid his 50 cents. In two
minutes he was back at George Pullman.</p>

<p>“There’s a man in that berth of mine,”
said he, hotly, “and he’s about ten feet
high. How am I going to sleep there, I’d
like to know? Go and look at him.”</p>

<p>In went Pullman&mdash;mad, too. The tall,
lank man’s knees were under his chin, his
arms were stretched across the bed and
his feet were stored comfortably&mdash;for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Pullman shook him until he awoke, and
then told him if he wanted the whole
berth he would have to pay $1.</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” said the tall man, “a
contract is a contract. I have paid you
50 cents for half this berth, and, as you
see, I’m occupying it. There’s the other
half,” pointing to a strip about six inches
wide. “Sell that and don’t disturb me
again.” And, so saying, the man with a
wart on his face went to sleep again. He
was Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_JOKE_ON_DOUGLAS">LINCOLN’S JOKE ON DOUGLAS.</h2>

<p>On one occasion, when Lincoln and
Douglas were “stumping” the State of
Illinois together as political opponents,
Douglas, who had the first speech, remarked
that in early life, his father, who
he said was an excellent cooper by trade,
apprenticed him out to learn the cabinet
business.</p>

<p>This was too good for Lincoln to let
pass, so when his turn came to reply, he
said:</p>

<p>“I had understood before that Mr.
Douglas had been bound out to learn the
cabinet-making business, which is all well
enough, but I was not aware until now
that his father was a cooper. I have no
doubt, however, that he was one, and I am
certain, also, that he was a very good one,
for (here Lincoln gently bowed toward
Douglas) he has made one of the best
whisky casks I have ever seen.”</p>

<p>As Douglas was a short heavy-set man,
and occasionally imbibed, the pith of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
joke was at once apparent, and most
heartily enjoyed by all.</p>

<p>On another occasion, Douglas in one of
his speeches, made a strong point against
Lincoln by telling the crowd that when
he first knew Mr. Lincoln he was a
“grocery-keeper,” and sold whisky, cigars,
etc. “Mr. L.,” he said, “was a very good
bar-tender!” This brought the laugh on
Lincoln, whose reply, however, soon
came, and then the laugh was on the
other side.</p>

<p>“What Mr. Douglas has said, gentlemen,”
replied Mr. Lincoln, “is true
enough; I did keep a grocery and I did
sell cotton, candles and cigars, and sometimes
whisky; but I remember in those
days that Mr. Douglas was one of my best
customers.</p>

<p>“Many a time have I stood on one side
of the counter and sold whisky to Mr.
Douglas on the other side, but the difference
between us now is this: I have
left my side of the counter, but Mr. Douglas
still sticks to his as tenaciously as
ever!”&mdash;From Lincoln’s Stories, by J. B.
McClure.</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLN_SHREWDLY_TRAPS_DOUGLAS">LINCOLN SHREWDLY TRAPS DOUGLAS.</h2>

<p>Perhaps no anecdote ever told of Mr.
Lincoln illustrates more forcibly his
“longheadedness” in laying plans, not
even that incident when he asked the
“Jedge” a question in his debate with Mr.
Douglas, which may be told as follows:</p>

<p>One afternoon during that joint debate
Mr. Lincoln was sitting with his friends,
planning the program, when he was observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to go off in a kind of reverie, and
for some time appeared totally oblivious
of everything around him. Then slowly
bringing his right hand up, holding it a
moment in the air and then letting it fall
with a quick slap upon his thigh, he
said:</p>

<p>“There, I am going to ask the ‘jedge’
(he always called him the ‘jedge’) a
question to-night, and I don’t care the
ghost of a continental which way he
answers it. If he answers it one way
he will lose the senatorship. If he answers
it the other way it will lose him
the Presidency.”</p>

<p>No one asked him what the question
was: but that evening it was the turn for
Mr. Douglas to speak first, and right in
the midst of his address, all at once Mr.
Lincoln roused up as if a new thought had
suddenly struck him, and said:</p>

<p>“Jedge, will you allow me to ask you
one question?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Mr. Douglas.</p>

<p>“Suppose, Jedge, there was a new town
or colony just started in some Western
territory; and suppose there were precisely
100 householders&mdash;voters&mdash;there;
and suppose, Jedge, that ninety-nine did
not want slavery and one did. What would
be done about it?”</p>

<p>Judge Douglas beat about the bush,
but failed to give a direct answer.</p>

<p>“No, no, Jedge, that won’t do. Tell
us plainly what will be done about it?”</p>

<p>Again Douglas tried to evade, but Lincoln
would not be put off, and he insisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
that a direct answer should be
given. At last Douglas admitted that the
majority would have their way by some
means or other.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln said no more. He had secured
what he wanted. Douglas had answered
the question as Illinois people
would have answered it, and he got the
Senatorship. But that answer was not
satisfactory to the people of the south.
In 1860 the Charleston convention split in
two factions and “it lost him the Presidency,”
and it made Abraham Lincoln
President.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_FAIRNESS_IN_DEBATE">LINCOLN’S FAIRNESS IN DEBATE.</h2>

<p>The first time I met Mr. Lincoln was
during his contest with Douglas. I was a
young clergyman in a small Illinois country
town. I was almost a stranger there
when Lincoln was announced to make a
speech. I went to the hall, got a seat well
forward and asked a neighbor to point out
Mr. Lincoln when he came in. “You
won’t have no trouble knowin’ him when
he comes,” said my friend, and I didn’t.
Soon a tall, gaunt man came down the
aisle and was greeted with hearty applause.</p>

<p>I was specially impressed with the fairness
and honesty of the man. He began
by stating Douglas’ points as fully and
fairly as Douglas could have done. It
struck me that he even overdid it in his
anxiety to put his opponent’s argument in
the most attractive form. But then he
went at those arguments and answered
them so convincingly that there was nothing
more to be said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln’s manner so charmed me
that I asked to meet him after the address,
and learning that he was to be in town
the next day attending court I invited him
to dine with me. He came, and we had an
interesting visit.</p>

<p>The thing that most impressed me was
his reverence for learning. Recently come
from divinity studies, I was full of books,
and he was earnest in drawing me out
about them. He was by no means ignorant
of literature, but as a man of affairs
naturally he had not followed new
things nor studied in the lines I had.
Philosophy interested him particularly,
and after we had talked about some of the
men then in vogue he remarked how much
he felt the need of reading and what a
loss it was to a man not to have grown up
among books.</p>

<p>“Men of force,” I answered, “can get on
pretty well without books. They do their
own thinking instead of adopting what
other men think.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Lincoln, “but books
serve to show a man that those original
thoughts of his aren’t very new, after all.”</p>

<p>I met Mr. Lincoln several times later,
the next time a long while after in another
place. I thought he would have forgotten
me, but he knew me on sight and
asked in the gentlest way possible about
my wife, who had been ill when he came
to see us. But of all my memories of Lincoln
the one that stands out strongest was
his interest in poetry and theology. He
loved the things of the spirit.&mdash;A Clergyman.</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLN_ASKED_HIS_FRIENDS_HELP">LINCOLN ASKED HIS FRIEND’S HELP
FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE.</h2>

<p>One of the most valued possessions of
the Gillespie family of Edwardsville, Ill.,
is a package of old letters, the paper
stained by time and the ink faded, but
each missive rendered invaluable, to them
at least, by the well-known signature of
Abraham Lincoln which adorns it. These
letters, so carefully preserved, are nearly
all of a political nature, and are addressed
to Hon. Joseph Gillespie, before the war
one of the leading politicians of Illinois, a
famous stump speaker, several times
member of the legislature, and for many
years one of Lincoln’s most intimate political
friends. The correspondence covers
a period of about ten years, from 1849
to 1858, and the most interesting feature
of this period, so far as Lincoln was concerned,
was his unsuccessful effort to be
elected to the United States senate. Probably
the first intimation of his ambition in
this direction was conveyed to Mr. Gillespie
in the following letter, the original of
which is now in the possession of the
Missouri Historical Association, having
been presented to that society by Mr.
Gillespie in 1876. A copy, however, forms
part of the family collection. It reads:</p>

<p>“Springfield, Ill., December 1, 1854.&mdash;(J.
Gillespie, Esq.)&mdash;Dear Sir: I have
really got it into my head to be United
States senator, and if I could have your
support my chances would be reasonably
good. But I know and acknowledge that
you have as just claims to the place as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
have; and, therefore, I cannot ask you to
yield to me if you are thinking of becoming
a candidate yourself. If, however,
you are not, then I would like to be remembered
by you; and also to have you
make a mark for me with the anti-Nebraska
members down your way. If you
know, and have no objection to tell, let
me know whether Trumbull intends to
make a push. If he does I suppose the
two men in St. Clair, and one or both in
Madison, will be for him.</p>

<p>“We have the legislature clearly enough
on joint ballot, but the senate is very close,
and Cullom told me to-day that the Nebraska
men will stave off the election if
they can. Even if we get into joint vote
we shall have difficulty to unite our forces.
Please write me and let this be confidential.
Your friend as ever.</p>

<h2 id="MAKING_LINCOLN_PRESENTABLE">MAKING LINCOLN PRESENTABLE.</h2>

<p>In narrating “When Lincoln Was First
Inaugurated,” Stephen Fiske tells of Mrs.
Lincoln’s efforts to have her husband look
presentable when receiving a delegation
that was to greet them upon reaching New
York City.</p>

<p>“The train stopped,” writes Mr. Fiske,
“and through the windows immense
crowds could be seen; the cheering
drowning the blowing off of steam of the
locomotive. Then Mrs. Lincoln opened
her hand bag and said:</p>

<p>“‘Abraham, I must fix you up a bit for
these city folks.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Lincoln gently lifted her upon the
seat before him; she parted, combed and
brushed his hair and arranged his black
necktie.</p>

<p>“‘Do I look nice now, mother?’ he affectionately
asked.</p>

<p>“‘Well, you’ll do, Abraham,’ replied
Mrs. Lincoln critically. So he kissed her
and lifted her down from the seat, and
turned to meet Mayor Wood, courtly and
suave, and to have his hand shaken by the
other New York officials.”</p>

<h2 id="EVIDENCE_OF_LINCOLNS_RELIGIOUS">EVIDENCE OF LINCOLN’S RELIGIOUS
BELIEF.</h2>

<p>There has been much controversy over
Lincoln’s religious beliefs, many claiming
that he was a deist while others have
sought to prove that he was an infidel.
Although never a member of any church,
there is much documentary as well as corroborative
evidence which show him to
have been a believer in Providence; and
in his parting address to his Springfield
neighbors, when leaving for Washington,
he said:</p>

<p>“Washington would never have succeeded
except for the aid of Divine Providence,
upon which he at all times relied.
I feel that I cannot succeed without the
same Divine blessing which sustained him;
and on the same Almighty Being I place
my reliance for support. And I hope you,
my friends, will all pray that I may receive
that Divine assistance, without which
I cannot succeed, but with which success
is certain.”</p>

<p>After his nomination for the Presidency
at the Republican convention of Chicago,
a committee visited him in Springfield and
gave him official notification of his nomination.</p>

<p>The ceremony over, Lincoln informed
the company that custom demanded that
he should treat them with something to
drink. He thereupon opened a door that
led into a room in the rear and called a
girl servant. When she appeared Lincoln
spoke something to her in an undertone,
and returned to his guests. In a few
minutes the girl appeared, bearing a large
waiter, containing several glass tumblers,
and a large pitcher in the midst, which she
placed upon the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln arose and gravely addressing
the company, said: “Gentlemen, we
must pledge our mutual healths in the
most healthy beverage which God has
given to man: it is the only beverage I
have ever used or allowed in my family,
and I cannot conscientiously depart from
it on the present occasion. It is pure
Adam’s ale from the spring.” So saying
he took a tumbler, touched it to his lips
and pledged them his highest respects in a
cup of cold water. Of course all his
guests were constrained to admire his consistency,
and to join in his example.&mdash;From

<p>Speaking of the dedication of the National
Cemetery at Gettysburg and President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Lincoln’s famous address, delivered
on that occasion, Nov. 19, 1863, Gov. Curtain,
of Pennsylvania, said that there had
been much discussion as to how and when
that address was written, and he continued:</p>

<p>“I can tell you all about that. Of
course I was there, and the President and
his cabinet had arrived and were at the
hotel. Soon after his arrival, as we were
sitting around in the parlor, Mr. Lincoln
looked thoughtful for a moment or two,
and then said: ‘I believe, gentlemen, the
committee are expecting me to say something
here to-day. If you will excuse me
I will go into this room here and prepare
it.’ After a time he returned, holding in
his hand a large, yellow government envelope,
on which he had written his address.</p>

<p>“‘Here, gentlemen,’ he said, ‘I want to
read this to you to see if it will do;’ and
sitting down he read it to us, and then
said: ‘Now for your criticisms. Will it
do? What do you say?’</p>

<p>“Several spoke in favor of it, and one or
two commended it in strong terms. ‘Well,’
says the President, ‘haven’t you any criticisms?
What do you say Seward?’</p>

<p>“Mr. Seward made one or two suggestions,
bearing on some slight verbal
changes, which I believe Mr. Lincoln incorporated.</p>

<p>“‘Now if you will allow me, gentlemen,’
continued the President, ‘I will copy this
off;’ and again withdrew and made a copy
of the address.”</p>

<h2 id="THE_GETTYSBURG_ADDRESS">THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS.</h2>

<p>“Ladies and Gentlemen: Four score and
seven years ago your fathers brought forth
upon this continent a new nation, conceived
in liberty and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war,
testing whether that nation, or any nation
so conceived and so dedicated, can long
endure. We are met on a great battlefield
of that war. We have come to dedicate
a portion of that field as a final resting-place
for those who here gave their
lives that the nation might live. It is
altogether fitting and proper that we
should do this.</p>

<p>“But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate,
we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow
this ground. The brave men, living
and dead, who struggled here have consecrated
it far above our power to add
to or detract. The world will little note,
nor long remember, what we say here;
but it can never forget what they did here.</p>

<p>“It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated
here to the unfinished work which
they who fought here have thus far so
nobly advanced. It is rather for us to
be here dedicated to the great task remaining
before us, that from these honored
dead we take increased devotion to
that cause for which they gave the last
full measure of devotion; that we here
highly resolve that these dead shall not
have died in vain; that this nation, under
God, shall have a new birth of freedom,
and that the government of the people,
by the people, and for the people shall not
perish from the earth.”</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLN_AS_A_RULER">LINCOLN AS A RULER.</h2>

<p>Mr. Henry Watterson, the distinguished
and scholarly editor of the widely-read
Louisville Courier Journal, once delivered
a lecture on “Lincoln.” The following is
part of what he said:</p>

<p>“After he was inaugurated President,
Mr. Lincoln evinced four great qualities
of mind and heart so great indeed that it
is doubtful if such a combination of kingly
talents was ever before or since concentrated
in the same man.” Mr. Watterson
then elaborated from historical facts, incidents,
and conclusions, as also from quotations
from Mr. Lincoln’s speeches and
letters, his direction and management of
generals and cabinet officers, his knowledge
of law, diplomacy, and military affairs,
his firmness for the right, his great
kindness of heart, and love of humanity,
the following propositions:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Lincoln was the wisest ruler of this
or any other age.</p>

<p>2. He had the firmness of the everlasting
hills.</p>

<p>3. His love of justice and righteousness
between man and man, and between
nations guided him in all things.</p>

<p>4. His kindness of heart, and his sympathies
for mankind were as an overflowing
fountain.</p>

<p>5. Abraham Lincoln was raised up of
God, and in a sense inspired for the place
and work he fulfilled in the world.</p>

</div>

<p>“Perhaps the most striking illustration
of superior wisdom and power as a ruler,”
said the speaker, “was his reply to Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Seward’s proposition to declare war
against France and Spain, and impliedly
against England and Russia, only one
month after Lincoln’s inauguration. The
reply was complete; so was his mastery
over the most astute and scholarly statesman
and diplomatist of the age. While
preparing that reply, the same night after
receiving Mr. Seward’s wonderful proposals,&mdash;a
reply which the best critics of
the world have declared needed not another
word, and would not have been
complete with one word lacking,&mdash;he was
overheard repeating to himself audibly
over and over, ‘One war at a time, one
war at a time, one war at a time.’”</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_REAL_OBJECT_IN_CONDUCTING">LINCOLN’S REAL OBJECT IN CONDUCTING

<p>The great Horace Greeley was wont to
criticize Lincoln’s plan of conducting the
war. He finally wanted to know “what
were the purposes and aims of the President,
anyway?” The following is Lincoln’s
reply, showing that his sole purpose was
to save the Union at whatever cost.</p>

<p>“If there be those who would not save
the Union unless they could at the same
time save slavery, I do not agree with
them. If there be those who would not
save the Union unless they could at the
same time destroy slavery, I do not agree
with them. My paramount object is to
save the Union, and not either to save or
destroy slavery. If I could save the Union
without freeing any slave, I would do it.
If I could save it by freeing all the slaves,
I would do it, and if I could do it by freeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
some and leaving others alone I would
also do that. What I do about slavery and
the colored race I do because I believe it
helps to save the Union, and what I forbear
I forbear because I do not believe it
helps to save the Union. I shall do less
whenever I shall believe that what I am
doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more
whenever I believe doing more will help
the cause.”</p>

hand to each, and upon Mr. Addison
enumerating the good qualities of his successor,
and congratulating the President
upon securing so eminent an officer, Mr.
Lincoln exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Yes, Addison, I have no doubt Mr.
Price is all that you say, but nothing can
compensate me for the loss of you, for
when you retire I shall be the homeliest
man in the employment of the government.”</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_KINDNESS_TO_A_DISABLED">LINCOLN’S KINDNESS TO A DISABLED
SOLDIER.</h2>

<p>One summer morning, shortly before
the close of the civil war, the not unusual
sight in Washington of an old veteran
hobbling along could have been seen on a
shady path that led from the executive
mansion to the war office. The old man
was in pain, and the pale, sunken cheeks
and vague, far-away stare in his eyes
betokened a short-lived existence. He
halted a moment and then slowly approached
a tall gentleman who was walking
along. “Good morning, sir. I am an
old soldier and would like to ask your
advice.”</p>

<p>The gentleman turned, and smiling
kindly, invited the poor old veteran to a
seat under a shady tree. There he listened
to the man’s story of how he had fought
for the Union and was severely wounded,
incapacitating him for other work in life,
and begged directions how to apply for
back pay due him and a pension, offering
his papers for examination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The gentleman looked over the papers
and then took out a card and wrote directions
on it, also a few words to the
pension bureau, desiring that speedy attention
be given to the applicant, and
handed it to him.</p>

<p>The old soldier looked at it, and with
tears in his eyes, thanked the tall gentleman,
who, with a sad look, bade him
good luck and hurried up the walk. Slowly
the old soldier read the card again, and
then turned it over to read the name of
the owner. More tears welled in his eyes
when he knew whom he had addressed
himself to, and his lips muttered: “I
am glad I fought for him and the country,
for he never forgets. God bless Abraham
Lincoln!”</p>

<h2 id="A_SAMPLE_OF_LINCOLNS_STATESMANSHIP">A SAMPLE OF LINCOLN’S STATESMANSHIP.</h2>

<p>President Lincoln, the man who said
and did so many kindly things, taught
Seward how to write state papers. He
was not only master of the situation in this
country, but when England and France
were about combining to recognize the
Confederacy he so won the admiration of
Lord Lyon, the British ambassador at
Washington, that that official informed
Lord Russell that he was in error when he
sent instructions to prepare the government
for the recognition of the South by
England, and Lord Lyon afterwards resigned
his office in consequence of the
opposition to Lincoln. At that time there
was a Russian fleet in New York harbor
under sealed instructions, to be opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
when France and England made their
move, and the instructions were afterward
found to be a command to the admiral to
report to his excellency, President Lincoln.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="TWO_GOOD_STORIES">TWO GOOD STORIES.</h2>

<p>At a cabinet meeting once the advisability
of putting a legend on greenbacks
similar to the In God We Trust legend
on the silver coins was discussed, and the
President was asked what his view was.
He replied: “If you are going to put a
legend on the greenbacks I would suggest
that of Peter and Paul: ‘Silver and gold
we have not, but what we have we’ll give
you.’”</p>

<p>On another occasion when Mr. Lincoln
was going to attend a political convention
one of his rivals, a liveryman, provided
him with a slow horse, hoping that he
would not reach his destination in time.
Mr. Lincoln got there, however, and when
he returned with the horse he said: “You
keep this horse for funerals, don’t you?”
“Oh, no,” replied the liveryman. “Well,
I’m glad of that, for if you did you’d
never get a corpse to the grave in time
for the resurrection.”</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLN_RAISES_A_WARNING_VOICE">LINCOLN RAISES A WARNING VOICE
AGAINST THE CONCENTRATION
OF GREAT WEALTH.</h2>

<p>“Liberty cannot long endure,” said
Webster, “when the tendency is to concentrate
wealth in the hands of a few.”</p>

<p>President Lincoln, in a message to Congress,
said of this danger: “Monarchy itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
is sometimes hinted at as a possible
refuge from the power of the people. In
my present position I could scarcely be
justified were I to omit raising a warning
voice against approaching despotism.
There is one point to which I ask a brief
attention. It is the effort to place capital
on an equal footing with, if not above,
labor in the structure of the government.
Let them beware of surrendering a political
power which they already have, and
which if surrendered will surely be used to
close the door of advancement against
such as they, and to fix new disabilities
and burdens upon them till all liberty shall
be lost.”</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLN_AND_THE_DYING_SOLDIER">LINCOLN AND THE DYING SOLDIER
BOY.</h2>

<p>One day in May, 1863, while the great
war was raging between the North and
South, President Lincoln paid a visit to
one of the military hospitals, says an exchange.
He had spoken many cheering
words of sympathy to the wounded as he
proceeded through the various wards, and
now he was at the bedside of a Vermont
boy of about sixteen years of age, who lay
there mortally wounded.</p>

<p>Taking the dying boy’s thin, white
hands in his own, the President said, in a
tender tone:</p>

<p>“Well, my poor boy, what can I do for
you?”</p>

<p>The young fellow looked up into the
President’s kindly face and asked: “Won’t
you write to my mother for me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“That I will,” answered Mr. Lincoln;
and calling for a pen, ink and paper, he
seated himself by the side of the bed and
wrote from the boy’s dictation. It was a
long letter, but the President betrayed no
sign of weariness. When it was finished,
he rose, saying:</p>

<p>“I will post this as soon as I get
back to my office. Now is there anything
else I can do for you?”</p>

<p>The boy looked up appealingly to the
President.</p>

<p>“Won’t you stay with me?” he asked.
“I do want to hold on to your hand.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln at once perceived the lad’s
meaning. The appeal was too strong for
him to resist; so he sat down by his side
and took hold of his hand. For two hours
the President sat there patiently as though
he had been the boy’s father.</p>

<p>When the end came he bent over and
folded the thin hands over his breast. As
he did so he burst into tears, and when,
soon afterward, he left the hospital, they
were still streaming down his cheeks.</p>

<h2 id="THE_DANDY_THE_BUGS_AND_THE">THE DANDY, THE BUGS AND THE
PRESIDENT.</h2>

<p>President Lincoln appointed as consul to
a South American country a young man
from Ohio who was a dandy. A wag met
the new appointee on his way to the White
House to thank the President. He was
dressed in the most extravagant style.
The wag horrified him by telling him
that the country to which he was assigned
was noted chiefly for the bugs that
abounded there and made life unbearable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
“They’ll bore a hole clean through you
before a week has passed,” was the comforting
assurance of the wag as they
parted at the White House steps. The
new consul approached Lincoln with disappointment
clearly written all over his
face. Instead of joyously thanking the
President, he told him the wag’s story of
the bugs. “I am informed, Mr. President,”
he said, “that the place is full of
vermin and that they could eat me up in
a week’s time.” “Well, young man,” replied
Lincoln, “if that’s true all I’ve got
to say is that if such a thing happened
they would leave a mighty good suit of
clothes behind.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLN_UPHELD_THE_HANDS_OF">LINCOLN UPHELD THE HANDS OF
GENERAL GRANT.</h2>

<p>In his “Campaigning With Grant,” in
the Century, Gen. Horace Porter told of
Gen. Halleck’s fear of trouble from enforcing
of the draft, and his desire that
Grant should send troops to the Northern
cities. Gen. Porter says:</p>

<p>On the evening of August 17 General
Grant was sitting in front of his quarters,
with several staff officers about him, when
the telegraph operator came over from his
tent and handed him a dispatch. He
opened it, and as he proceeded with the
reading of it his face became suffused with
smiles. After he had finished it he broke
into a hearty laugh. We were curious to
know what could produce so much merriment
in the general in the midst of the
trying circumstances which surrounded
him. He cast his eyes over the dispatch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
again, and then remarked: “The President
has more nerve than any of his advisers.
This is what he says after reading
my reply to Halleck’s dispatch.” He then
read aloud to us the following:</p>

<p>“I have seen your dispatch expressing
your unwillingness to break your hold
where we are. Neither am I willing. Hold
on with a bulldog grip, and chew and
choke as much as possible.</p>

<p class="right">“A. LINCOLN.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="WHY_LINCOLN_TOLD_STORIES">WHY LINCOLN TOLD STORIES.</h2>

<p>Mr. Edward Rosewater, editor of the
Omaha Bee, said he believed Lincoln got
relaxation by his story telling, and that the
hearing of a good story gave him the
mental rest that he so much needed during
those brain-taxing days. These stories
came out under the most trying circumstances
and at the most solemn times.
A striking instance of this was just after
the battle of Fredericksburg. After the
Union armies were defeated an official who
had seen the battle hurried to Washington.
He reached there about midnight and went
directly to the White House. President
Lincoln had not yet retired, and the man
was at once received. Lincoln had already
heard some reports of the battle.
He was feeling very sad and rested his
head upon his hands while the story was
repeated to him. As the man saw his intense
suffering he remarked:</p>

<p>“I wish, Mr. President, that I might be
a messenger of good news instead of bad.
I wish I could tell you how to conquer or
to get rid of those rebellious States.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>At this President Lincoln looked
up and a smile came across his
face as he said: “That reminds me
of two boys out in Illinois who took
a short cut across an orchard. When
they were in the middle of the field
they saw a vicious dog bounding toward
them. One of the boys was sly enough to
climb a tree, but the other ran around the
tree, with the dog following. He kept
running until, by making smaller circles
than it was possible for his pursuer to
make, he gained upon the dog sufficiently
to grasp his tail. He held on to the tail
with a desperate grip until nearly exhausted,
when he called to the boy up the
tree to come down and help.</p>

<p>“What for?” said the boy.</p>

<p>“I want you to help me let this dog go.”</p>

<p>“Now,” concluded President Lincoln,
“if I could only let the rebel States go it
would be all right. But I am compelled
to hold on to them and make them stay.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLN_REWARDS_A_MAN_FOR_KINDNESS">LINCOLN REWARDS A MAN FOR KINDNESS
THIRTY YEARS AFTER
THE OCCURRENCE.</h2>

<p>Lincoln’s indebtedness, in consequence
of the closing out of his general store
at New Salem, was such that it took him
many years to extinguish all. There was
one man among his creditors who would
not wait, but secured a judgment against
Lincoln and his personal effects were
levied upon. Among them was his surveying
instrument on which he depended
for his living. At the sale a farmer friend
of Lincoln’s named James Short bought
the horse and surveying instruments for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
$120 and generously turned them over to
their former owner. This kindness deeply
touched the future President of the United
States, who, some years later, repaid with
interest the money so kindly advanced by
Mr. Short.</p>

<p>Thirty years later, while Lincoln was
President, he heard that James Short was
living in California. Financial reverses
had overtaken him some years previously
and he left his home near New Salem and
emigrated with his family to the State on
the Pacific Ocean. One day Mr. Short
received a letter from Washington informing
him that he had been appointed an
Indian agent. It will thus be seen that
Lincoln never forgot a benefactor.</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLN_A_MERCIFUL_MAN">LINCOLN A MERCIFUL MAN.</h2>

<p>Abraham Lincoln had a heart that was
full of mercy; he could not bear to see
even an animal suffer, and would not tolerate
any wanton cruelty to animals.
There are numerous instances of his mercifulness,
but the following story will serve
to show how kindly disposed the man was:</p>

<p>One day the major-general commanding
the forces in and around Washington,
came to the office of Mr. Dana with a spy
whom one of his men had captured. Mr.
Dana was assistant secretary of war. The
officer informed Mr. Dana that the spy
had been tried by court-martial and had
been sentenced to death. He handed Mr.
Dana the warrant for his execution, which
was to take place at six o’clock the following
morning. The warrant must be signed
by the President, or in his absence by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
some officer with authority to sign it.
President Lincoln was absent from Washington
at that time and was not expected
back before the afternoon of the next day.
It therefore became necessary for Mr. Dana
to sign the warrant for the execution of
the spy, in accordance with the decision
of the court. But President Lincoln got
home at two o’clock in the early morning
and on learning of the affair at once
stopped the whole thing and thus spared
the man’s life. It may be here stated that
the law of nations in regard to the punishment
of spies when captured is death.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_HUMOROUS_ADVICE_TO_A">LINCOLN’S HUMOROUS ADVICE TO A
DISTINGUISHED BACHELOR.</h2>

<p>When the Prince of Wales was betrothed
to the Princess Alexandria, Queen Victoria
sent a letter to every sovereign of
Europe, and to President Lincoln, announcing
the fact. The ambassador of
England then at Washington was Lord
Lyons, and he was a bachelor. He requested
an audience with President Lincoln
in order that he might present the
important letter in person.</p>

<p>He called at the White House in company
with Secretary Seward and addressed
the President as follows:</p>

<p>“May it please your Excellency, I hold
in my hand an autograph letter from my
royal mistress, Queen Victoria, which I
have been commanded to present to your
Excellency. In it she informs your Excellency
that her son, his Royal Highness
the Prince of Wales, is about to contract
a matrimonial alliance with her Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Highness the Princess Alexandria of Denmark.”</p>

<p>After the use of such diplomatic and
high-sounding language one would naturally
suppose Lincoln would require a few
moments to collect his thoughts and reply
in kind. Not so, however. His reply
was short, simple and expressive, as follows:</p>

<p>“Lord Lyons, go thou and do likewise.”</p>

<p>A witness of the above incident said:
“It is doubtful if an English ambassador
was ever addressed in this manner before,
and it would be interesting to learn what
success he met with in putting the reply in
diplomatic language, when he reported it
to her Majesty.”&mdash;From Lincoln’s Stories,
by J. B. McClure.</p>

<h2 id="HOW_LINCOLN_ANSWERED_A_DELICATE">HOW LINCOLN ANSWERED A DELICATE
QUESTION.</h2>

<p>At the time when the Union soldiers
were hunting for Jeff Davis, some one
asked the President: “Mr. Lincoln, suppose
they were to find Davis, and, in order
to capture him, it was necessary to shoot
him. Would you want them to do so?”</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln said: “When I was a boy,
a man lecturing on temperance stayed
at our house over night. It was a cold,
stormy night, and the man was quite
chilled when he reached home after the
meeting. He said if they would give him
a hot lemonade he thought it would prevent
his taking cold. Some one suggested
that some spirits added would be beneficial.
‘Well,’ he said, ‘you might put in
some unbeknown to me!’”</p>

<p>On one occasion, exasperated at the
discrepancy between the aggregate of
troops forwarded to McClellan and the
number the same general reported as
having received, Lincoln exclaimed,
“Sending men to that army is like shoveling
fleas across a barnyard&mdash;half of them
never get there.”</p>

<p>To a politician who had criticized his
course he wrote, “Would you have me
drop the war where it is, or would you
prosecute it in future with elder stalk
squirts charged with rosewater?”</p>

<p>When, on his first arrival in Washington
as President, he found himself besieged
by office seekers, while the war was
breaking out, he said, “I feel like a man
letting lodgings at one end of the house
while the other end is on fire.”</p>

<h2 id="WHY_LINCOLN_MISTOOK_A_DRIVER_TO">WHY LINCOLN MISTOOK A DRIVER TO

<p>The first corps of the army commanded
by General Reynolds was once reviewed
by the President on a beautiful plain at the
north of Potomac Creek, about eight miles
from Hooker’s headquarters. The party
rode thither in an ambulance over a rough,
corduroy road, and as they passed over
some of the more difficult portions of the
jolting way the ambulance driver, who sat
well in front, occasionally let fly a volley of
suppressed oaths at his wild team of six
mules.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Lincoln, leaning forward,
touched the man on the shoulder, and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“Excuse me, my friend, are you an
Episcopalian?”</p>

<p>The man, greatly startled, looked around
and replied:</p>

<p>“No, Mr. President; I am a Methodist.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Lincoln, “I thought you
must be an Episcopalian, because you
swear just like Governor Seward, who is
a church warden.”</p>

<h2 id="A_CLERGYMAN_WHO_TALKED_BUT">A CLERGYMAN WHO TALKED BUT

<p>A clergyman of some prominence was
one day presented to Lincoln, who gave

patient waiting:</p>

<p>“I am now ready to hear what you have
to say.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bless you, sir,” replied the clergyman,
“I have nothing special to say. I
merely called to pay my respects.”</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” said the President, rising
promptly, his face showing instant relief,
and with both hands grasping that of his
visitor; “I am very glad to see you, indeed.
It is a relief to find a clergyman, or any
other man, for that matter, who has nothing
to say. I thought you had come to
preach to me.”</p>

<h2 id="HOW_LINCOLN_RECEIVED_A_JACKKNIFE">HOW LINCOLN RECEIVED A JACKKNIFE

<p>Considering his own personality Lincoln
was very indifferent. He was perfectly
aware that many people talked about his
“awkwardness” and homely personal appearance.
Far from feeling hurt at the remarks
occasionally flung at him he rather
enjoyed them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>One day he was traveling in a train. He
was addressed, without any formal introduction,
by a stranger in the car, who said:</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir, but I have an article
in my possession which belongs to you.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” Lincoln inquired, much
surprised.</p>

<p>The stranger took a jackknife from his
pocket.</p>

<p>“This knife,” said he, “was placed in
my hands some years ago, with the injunction
that I was to keep it until I found
a man uglier than myself. I have carried
it from that time to this. Allow me to
say now, sir, that I think you are fairly
entitled to the property.”</p>

office he arranged to make an excursion
in some direction and sent his son, ‘Bob,’
to arrange for a special train. It happened
that the railroad superintendent was a
strong Whig. As such he had no favors
to bestow upon the President and informed
Bob that the road did not run any special
trains for the President.</p>

<p>“‘What,’ said Bob Tyler, ‘did you not
furnish a special for the funeral of Gen.
Harrison?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said the superintendent, ‘and if
you’ll bring your father in that condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
you shall have the best train on the
road.’”</p>

<p>During the war an Austrian count applied

Austrian Minister, but as if fearing that
his importance might not be duly appreciated,
he proceeded to explain his nobility
and high standing. With a merry
twinkle in his eye, Mr. Lincoln laid his
hand on the count’s shoulder and said:</p>

<p>“Never mind: you shall be treated with
just as much consideration for all that.”</p>

<p>It is not generally known that Abraham
Lincoln sent a substitute to the war
against the South, but such is a fact. During
the earlier days of the war it seems
to have been the desire of all prominent
men in Washington to have a representative
in the ranks, and Lincoln was no exception
to the rule. At that time there
was a minister named Staples in Washington,
one of whose sons, then aged nineteen,
had a desire to go to the front. Lincoln
heard of him, and after a conference
selected him as his representative, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
he proved worthy, for he won honor on
the field. He survived the war and
finally died in Stroudsburg. The inscription
on the stone over his grave reads as
follows: “J. Summerfield Staples, a private
of Company C, One Hundred and
Seventy-sixth Regiment, P. V. Also a
member of the Second regiment, D. C.

<p>“I am well acquainted with Mr. &mdash;&mdash;,

he has a wife and baby; together they
ought to be worth $50,000 to any man.
Secondly, he has an office in which there

worth, say, $1. Last of all, there is in one
corner a large rat hole, which will bear

<p>At a time when the war crisis was at its

how to conduct the war, had just finished
explaining an elaborate idea, when Mr.
Lincoln remarked:</p>

<p>“That reminds me of a man in Illinois,
who, in driving the hoops of a hogshead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to ‘head it up,’ was much annoyed by the
constant falling in of the top. At length
a bright idea struck him of putting his
little boy inside to hold it up. This he
did. But when the job was completed
there arose the more serious question, how
to get the boy out of the hogshead. Your
plan sounds feasible, but how are you to
get the boy out?”</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_INAUGURATION">LINCOLN’S INAUGURATION.</h2>

<p>In the March “Ladies’ Home Journal”
Stephen Fiske graphically recalls the excitement
and apprehension and the condition
of the country “When Lincoln Was
First Inaugurated.” He tells the incidents
of the memorable journey to the
capitol, of Mr. Lincoln’s reception, and
gives a rather grewsome picture of the
inaugural ceremonies. “As I walked up
to the capitol the wide, dusty streets
were already crowded,” he writes; “regular
troops were posted at intervals along
Pennsylvania avenue. Sharpshooters
were climbing over the roofs of the
houses. A mounted officer at every corner
was ready to report to General Scott
the passage of the procession. Detectives
in plain clothes squirmed through
the masses of people. The policemen had
been instructed to arrest for ‘disorderly
conduct’ any person who called Mr. Lincoln
an opprobrious name or uttered a
disloyal sentiment. There was much suppressed
excitement, and the prophetic
word ‘assassination’ was in every mind.</p>

<p>“President Buchanan, whose term expired
at noon, was engaged until half an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
hour later in signing the bills that had
been hurriedly passed, but the congressional
clock had been put back to legalize
the transaction. At last he drove
down to Willard’s, and the procession
was formed. The President and President-elect
rode in an open barouche; but
this confidence in the people was more
apparent than real. On the front seat
were Senators Baker and Pearce; a guard
of honor of the regular cavalry surrounded
the carriage; beyond were
mounted marshals four files deep. From
the sidewalks no one could accurately distinguish
Mr. Lincoln. Close behind
marched regiments of regulars and marines,
fully armed. It seemed more like
escorting a prisoner to his doom than a
President to his inauguration. Little
cheering and no enthusiasm greeted the
procession. Every now and then an arrest
for ‘disorderly conduct’ was quickly
and quietly made in the crowd. The sunshine
was bright, but the whole affair
was as gloomy as if Mr. Lincoln were riding
through an enemy’s country&mdash;as, indeed,
he was.”</p>

for a chance to shake hands with the
Great Emancipator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“During this time,” says Mr. Sherman,
“I was wondering what I should say and
what Lincoln would do when we met. At
last it came my turn to be presented. Lincoln
looked at me a moment, extended
his hand, and said: ‘You’re a pretty tall
fellow, aren’t you? Stand up here with
me, back to back, and let’s see which is
the taller.’</p>

<p>“In another moment I was standing
back to back with the greatest man of his
age. Naturally I was quite abashed by
this unexpected evidence of democracy.</p>

<p>“‘You’re from the West, aren’t you,’
inquired Lincoln.</p>

<p>“‘My home is in Ohio,’ I replied.</p>

<p>“‘I thought so,’ he said; ‘that’s the kind
of men they raise out there.’”</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLN_AND_THE_SENTINEL">LINCOLN AND THE SENTINEL.</h2>

<p>A slight variation of the traditional
sentry story is related by C. C. Buel, in
the current Century. It was a cold, blusterous
winter night. Says Mr. Buel:</p>

<p>“Mr. Lincoln emerged from the front
door, his lank figure bent over as he drew
tightly about his shoulders the shawl
which he employed for such protection;
for he was on his way to the War Department,
at the west corner of the grounds,
where in times of battle he was wont to
get the midnight despatches from the
field. As the blast struck him he thought
of the numbness of the pacing sentry, and
turning to him, said: ‘Young man, you’ve
got a cold job to-night; step inside, and
stand guard there.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘My orders keep me out here,’ the soldier
replied.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said the President, in his argumentative
tone; ‘but your duty can be
performed just as well inside as out here,
and you’ll oblige me by going in.’</p>

<p>“‘I have been stationed outside,’ the
soldier answered, and resumed his beat.</p>

<p>“‘Hold on there!’ said Mr. Lincoln, as
he turned back again; ‘it occurs to me
that I am commander-in-chief of the
army, and I order you to go inside.’”</p>

<h2 id="ORIGIN_OF_WITH_MALICE_TOWARD">ORIGIN OF “WITH MALICE TOWARD
NONE, ETC.”</h2>

<p>It was during Lincoln’s second inauguration
as President of the United States
that he gave voice to these famous and oft-quoted
words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“With malice toward none,</div>
<div class="verse">With charity for all.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The above occur in the last paragraph
in his second inaugural speech, delivered
at Washington, D. C., March 4, 1865.</p>

<h2 id="HIS_GOOD_MEMORY_OF_NAMES">HIS GOOD MEMORY OF NAMES.</h2>

<p>The following story illustrates the power
of Mr. Lincoln’s memory of names and
faces. When he was a comparatively young
man and a candidate for the Illinois Legislature,
he made a personal canvass of the
district. While “swinging around the
circle” he stopped one day and took dinner
with a farmer in Sangamon county.</p>

<p>Years afterward, when Mr. Lincoln had
become President, a soldier came to call
on him at the White House. At the first
glance the Chief Executive said: “Yes, I
remember; you used to live on the Danville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
road. I took dinner with you when
I was running for the Legislature. I recollect
that we stood talking out at the
barnyard gate, while I sharpened my jackknife.”</p>

<p>“Y-a-a-s,” drawled the soldier; “you
did. But say, wherever did you put that
whetstone? I looked for it a dozen times,
but I never could find it after the day you
used it. We allowed as how mabby you
took it ’long with you.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Lincoln, looking serious and
pushing away a lot of documents of state
from the desk in front of him. “No, I
put it on top of that gatepost&mdash;that high
one.”</p>

<p>“Well!” exclaimed the visitor, “mabby
you did. Couldn’t anybody else have put
it there, and none of us ever thought of
looking there for it.”</p>

<p>The soldier was then on his way home,
and when he got there the first thing he
did was to look for the whetstone. And
sure enough, there it was, just where Lincoln
had laid it fifteen years before. The
honest fellow wrote a letter to the Chief
Magistrate, telling him that the whetstone
had been found, and would never be lost
again.</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_GRIEF_OVER_THE_DEFEAT">LINCOLN’S GRIEF OVER THE DEFEAT
OF THE UNION ARMY.</h2>

<p>We had been talking of the war, and
the late Governor Curtin, of Pennsylvania,
broke out suddenly and said:</p>

<p>“It was just after the battle of Fredericksburg.
I had been down there and
came up to Washington by the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
boat. I arrived at the foot of Seventh
street a little after midnight. Just as I
landed a messenger met me, saying that
the President wanted to see me at once
at the White House. I took a carriage
and went directly there. I sent in my
card, and word came back that the President
had retired, but that he requested
me to come up to his bedroom. I found
him in bed, and as I entered the room he
reached out his hand, shook hands, and
said:</p>

<p>“‘Well, Governor; so you have been
down to the battle-field?’</p>

<p>“‘Battle-field? Slaughter-pen! It was
a terrible slaughter, Mr. Lincoln.’ I was
sorry in a moment, that I had said it, for
he groaned, and began to wring his hands
and took on with terrible agony of spirits.
He sat up on the edge of the bed, and
moaned and groaned in anguish. He
walked the floor of the room, and uttered
exclamations of grief, one after another,
and I remember his saying over and over
again: ‘What has God put me in this
place for?’ I tried to comfort him, and
could hardly forgive myself for not being
more careful and considerate of his feelings.”</p>

<h2 id="THREE_STORIES_OF_LINCOLN_BY">THREE STORIES OF LINCOLN BY
SENATOR PALMER.</h2>

<p>“Speaking of Lincoln’s birthday,” said
Senator Palmer yesterday, “reminds me
that the very last case Lincoln ever tried
was one in which I, too, was engaged. It
was in Springfield, in June, 1860, after Mr.
Lincoln had received the Presidential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
nomination. Old David Baker, who had
been a Senator in the early days, had sued
the trustees of Shurtleff College, my alma
mater, for expelling his grandson, a lad
named Will Gilbert. Mr. Lincoln appeared
for the prosecution. I was the college attorney.
Mr. Lincoln came into court and
the Judge said to him: ‘Mr. Lincoln, I’ll
argue this case for you. You have too
much on your hands already. You haven’t
any case.’ And he explained the law and
application.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said Mr. Lincoln, with a smile,
‘don’t you want to hear a speech from
me?’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said the Judge, and the last case
Mr. Lincoln tried he&mdash;well, he didn’t try it
at all.”</p>

<p>“The first time I met Mr. Lincoln was in
1839, when I went to Springfield to be admitted
to the bar. He was already recognized
as a Whig leader. He wore, I remember,
a suit of linsey woolsey, that
could not have been worth more than $8
even in those days. The last time I saw
him was in February of 1865. I had come
to Washington at the request of the Governor,
to complain that Illinois had been
credited with 18,000 too few troops. I saw
Mr. Lincoln one afternoon, and he asked
me to come again in the morning.</p>

<p>“Next morning I sat in the ante-room
while several officers were relieved. At
length I was told to enter the President’s
room. Mr. Lincoln was in the hands of
the barber.</p>

<p>“‘Come in, Palmer,’ he called out, ‘come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in. You’re home folks. I can shave before
you. I couldn’t before those others,
and I have to do it some time.’</p>

<p>“We chatted about various matters, and
at length I said:</p>

<p>“‘Well, Mr. Lincoln, if anybody had
told me that in a great crisis like this the
people were going out to a little one-horse
town and pick out a one-horse lawyer
for President I wouldn’t have believed
it.’</p>

<p>“Mr. Lincoln whirled about in his chair,
his face white with lather, a towel under
his chin. At first I thought he was angry.
Sweeping the barber away he leaned forward,
and placing one hand on my knee
said:</p>

<p>“‘Neither would I. But it was a time
when a man with a policy would have
been fatal to the country. I have never
had a policy. I have simply tried to do
what seemed best each day, as each day
came.’</p>

<p>“Lincoln was not an eloquent man. He
was a strong lawyer, and an ingenious one.
His stronghold was his ability to reason
logically and clearly. He was a very self-contained
man, and not easily excited. I
remember the night when the news of his
election was received at Springfield. The
patriotic ladies of the town were serving
a lunch in an upper room opposite the
capitol. Mr. Lincoln was there, and read
the returns as they were brought to him.
The returns from New York decided the
day. Mr. Lincoln stood up and read the
telegram. He was the calmest man in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
room. When he had finished he said,
simply, ‘Well I must go and tell my
wife.’”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="HIS_FAMOUS_SECOND_INAUGURAL">HIS FAMOUS SECOND INAUGURAL
ADDRESS.</h2>

<p>Lincoln was an orator as well as a
statesman and many of his speeches will
go down in history through all time. In
his second inaugural address he made use
of the following striking expressions:</p>

<p>“On the occasion corresponding to this
four years ago all thoughts were anxiously
directed to an impending civil war.
Both parties deprecated war, but one of
them would make war rather than let
the Nation survive, and the other would
accept war rather than let it perish; and
the war came. Both read the same Bible
and pray to the same God, and each invokes
His aid against the other. It may
seem strange that any men should dare to
ask a just God’s assistance in wringing
their bread from the sweat of other men’s
faces; but let us judge not, that we be
not judged. The prayer of both could not
be answered. That of another has been
answered fully. With malice towards none,
with charity for all, with firmness in the
right, as God gives us to see the right,
let us finish the work we are in, to bind
up the Nation’s wounds, to care for him
who shall have borne the battle, and for
his widow and his orphans, to do all
which may achieve and cherish a just and
a lasting peace among ourselves and with
all Nations.”</p>

<p>Eloquent, is it not? Beautiful, is it not?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
And yet there is not a word in it that a
child could not understand. Lincoln’s
English was like himself, simple, forcible,
direct, natural, eloquent, full of heart-throbs.
As his unadorned language still
stirs the heart of every American like the
roll of a drum, and as beside it the tinsels,
and flowers, and gewgaws of polished
speech are but as pulseless marble, so the
rugged nature of America’s greatest man
looms above all lesser public men, the
spotless, genius-crowned Shasta of our
National history.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLN_SAID_EVEN_A_REBEL_COULD">LINCOLN SAID EVEN A REBEL COULD
BE SAVED.</h2>

<p>This story well illustrates Lincoln’s
humanity of character which found expression
in his famous words of “charity
for all, and malice toward none.” It appears
that Mr. Shrigley, of Philadelphia,
a Universalist, had been nominated for
hospital chaplain. A protesting delegation
went to Washington to see President
Lincoln on the subject. The following
was the interview:</p>

<p>“We have called, Mr. President, to confer
with you in regard to the appointment
of Mr. Shrigley, of Philadelphia, as hospital
chaplain.”</p>

<p>The President responded: “Oh, yes,
gentlemen. I have sent his name to the
Senate, and he will no doubt be confirmed
at an early date.”</p>

<p>One of the young men replied: “We
have not come to ask for the appointment,
but to solicit you to withdraw the nomination.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah!” said Lincoln, “that alters the
case; but on what grounds do you wish
the nomination withdrawn?”</p>

<p>The answer was: “Mr. Shrigley is not
sound in his theological opinions.”</p>

<p>The President inquired: “On what
question is the gentleman unsound?”</p>

<p>Response: “He does not believe in
endless punishment; not only so, sir, but
he believes that even the rebels themselves
will be finally saved.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” inquired the President.</p>

<p>The members of the committee responded,
“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen, if that be so, and
there is any way under Heaven whereby
the rebels can be saved, then, for God’s
sake and their sakes, let the man be appointed.”</p>

<p>It is almost needless to add that Mr.
Shrigley was appointed, and served until
the close of the war.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="WASHINGTON_AND_LINCOLN_COMPARED">WASHINGTON AND LINCOLN COMPARED.</h2>

<p>At a banquet given in his honor on
Washington’s birthday, in New York,
February 22, 1897, the eloquent and gifted
Chauncey M. Depew made the following
comparison between America’s two greatest
heroes:</p>

<p>“This February, for the first time, both
Washington’s and Lincoln’s birthdays
have been made legal holidays. Never
since the creation of man were two human
beings so unlike, so nearly the extremes
of opposition to each other, as Washington
and Lincoln. The one an aristocrat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
by birth, by breeding, and association, the
other in every sense and by every surrounding
a democrat. As the richest man
in America, a large slave-holder, the possessor
of an enormous landed estate, and
the leader and representative of the property,
the culture, and the colleges of the
colonial period, Washington stood for the
conservation and preservation of law and
order.</p>

<p>“And yet millionaire, slaveholder and
aristocrat, in its best sense, that he was,
as he lived, so at any time he would have
died for the immortal principle put by the
Puritans in their charter, adopted in the
cabin of the Mayflower, reënacted in the
Declaration of Independence, of the
equality of all men before the law and
of the equal opportunity for all to rise.
Lincoln, on the other hand, was born in
a cabin, among that class known as
poor whites in slaveholding times, who
held no position and whose condition was
so helpless as to paralyze ambition and
effort. His situation so far as his surroundings
were concerned had considerable
mental but little moral improvement
by the removal to Indiana and subsequently
to Illinois.</p>

<p>“Anywhere in the Old World a man
born amidst such environments and teachings,
and possessed of unconquerable
energy and ambition and the greatest
powers of eloquence and constructive
statesmanship, would have been a Socialist
and the leader of a social revolt. He
might have been an Anarchist. His one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
ambition would have been to break the
crust above him and shatter it to pieces.
He would see otherwise no opportunity
for himself and his fellows in social or
political or professional life. But Lincoln
attained from the log cabin of the
poor white in the wilderness the same position
which Washington reached from his
palatial mansion and baronial estate on
the Potomac; he made the same fight unselfishly,
patriotically, and grandly for the
preservation of the republic that Washington
had done for its creation and foundation.
Widely as they are separated, these
two heroes of the two great crises of our
national life stand together in representing
the solvent powers, the inspiring processes,
and the hopeful opportunities of
American liberty.”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLN_REMEMBERED_HIM">LINCOLN REMEMBERED HIM.</h2>

<p>A stair-carpenter happened to see a
picture of the martyred President. Instantly
the tones of his voice softened, his
eyes grew moist with tears, and the whole
expression of his face changed.</p>

<p>Then he told us his “story of Lincoln.”
He had been shot through the lungs when
on picket in ’63, and was in the hospital
at Fortress Monroe.</p>

<p>For weeks he had been lying there, till
he had grown dreadfully homesick, and
felt as if the only thing that could cure him
was to get home to Maryland.</p>

<p>One morning Lincoln visited the hospital,
and as he was passing around,
pausing before each cot to speak a word
of cheer to each wounded soldier, this one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
made up his mind that if he gave him a
chance, he would make known his wants.</p>

<p>At last his turn came.</p>

<p>“You seem very comfortable, my
friend,” Lincoln said.</p>

<p>“Not so comfortable as I should be if
I could get home to Maryland,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“S. Stover, Co. H, 2d Maryland Volunteers,”
was promptly answered, and Lincoln
passed on.</p>

<p>In just three days came an order from
the President to transfer Private Stover,
Co. H, 2d Md. Vols., by water to the
hospital at Annapolis.</p>

<p>“I was surprised myself,” he said; “for
I had watched him as long as he was in
sight, and when I saw him go through the
door without writing down my name and
company, I gave up all hope of seeing my
Maryland again.</p>

<p>“And it has always been a mystery to
me that a man with so much to think of
should keep in mind the name, regiment
and company of a private soldier.”</p>

<p>As he turned away to conceal the tears
he could not keep back, it was plain how
large a place the thoughtful kindness of
that great man had won in the heart of the
poor, homesick, wounded soldier.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="WHY_LINCOLN_PARDONED_THEM">WHY LINCOLN PARDONED THEM.</h2>

<p>It was President Lincoln’s intense love
for his fellow men that led him to disapprove
of the findings of court-martial,
whenever there was a possible excuse,
particularly in the cases of soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
charged with desertion, with having fallen
asleep at a post of duty, or with other offenses.</p>

<p>Secretary Stanton always insisted upon
the strictest discipline in the army and
frequently urged that derelict soldiers receive
the severest punishment of military
law and custom, but Lincoln rarely took
any advice on such matters. He had meditated
deeply on that subject and consulted
his own judgment in disposing of
cases of that kind that came before him.</p>

<p>The late Joseph Holt, who recently died
at Washington, was judge advocate general
of the army during the whole period of
the war and it became his duty to report
many cases of alleged cowardice of soldiers
as well as other offenses. President
Lincoln carefully read every line of the
charges against such men, and as soon as
he saw the slightest chance to excuse the
poor fellow, a gleam of satisfaction would
pass over his serious face. Then folding
the papers together he placed them in a
pigeon hole of his desk, and with his big
eyes looking into those of the judge advocate
standing before him, he would say:</p>

<p>“Holt, we will let those soldiers go.
Order them set free.”</p>

<p>It was after the battle of Chancellorsville
that charges were brought against
several men for failing to march with their
regiments into the fight at a time when
they were most needed. The charge of
desertion was made.</p>

<p>When Secretary Stanton heard of these
cases he commanded Judge Holt to present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the charges against the men to the
President in the strongest possible terms.</p>

<p>“We need stronger discipline in the
army,” said the stern secretary of war to
the judge advocate. “The time has come
when the President must yield to our
opinion.”</p>

<p>Judge Holt was himself one of the
ablest lawyers of his day, and had won
fame as a forensic orator long before the
war.</p>

<p>“In presenting these cases,” said he to
the writer a few months before his death,
“in obedience to the wish of the secretary
of war, I used all the legal acumen at
my command. One morning, with my
papers all ready (and I was deeply in
earnest in the matter), I proceeded to the
White House; and, as I entered his private
office, the President looked up with
his long, sad face, saying:</p>

<p>“‘Ah! Holt, what have you there?’</p>

<p>“‘I have some important cases for your
careful consideration, Mr. President, with
documentary evidence sufficient to condemn
every man.’</p>

<p>“He took the papers and read them
carefully, stopping at times to reflect, then
read on until he finished. There was no
change in his countenance this time, unless
that it grew more sad and his expression
more serious. I had covered the
cases in question with strong and convincing
argument and evidence. He
finally raised his eyes from the last paper
and gazed intently through the window at
some object across the Potomac. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
rising from his chair, with the papers all
folded together, he placed them in a
pigeon hole already filled with similar documents.
With his tall, gaunt form facing
me, he spoke, in deep, sad tones, that
would have touched the heart of the sternest
officer of the army:</p>

<p>“‘Holt (it was his custom to mention
only the last name), you acknowledge
those men have a previous record for
bravery. It is not the first time they have
faced danger; and they shall not be shot
for this one offense.’</p>

<p>“I then thought it was my duty as the
head of my department of military justice
to make further argument. For I
knew Stanton would nearly explode with
rage when he heard of the President’s decision.
I began to speak and Lincoln sat
down again, giving me his closest attention.
Then, rising from his chair and
riveting his eyes upon me, he said:</p>

<p>“‘Holt, were you ever in battle?’</p>

<p>“‘I have never been.’</p>

<p>“‘Did Stanton ever march in the first
line, to be shot at by an enemy like those
men did?’</p>

<p>“‘I think not, Mr. President.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, I tried it in the Black Hawk
war, and I remember one time I grew
awful weak in the knees when I heard the
bullets whistle around me and saw the
enemy in front of me. How my legs carried
me forward I cannot now tell, for I
thought every minute that I would sink
to the ground. The men against whom
those charges have been made probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
were not able to march into battle. Who
knows that they were able? I am opposed
to having soldiers shot for not facing danger
when it is not known that their legs
would carry them into danger. Send this
dispatch ordering them to be set free.’
And they were set free that day.”</p>

<h2 id="THE_LINCOLN_PORTRAITS">THE LINCOLN PORTRAITS.</h2>

<p>The Lincoln apotheosis is much more
satisfactory than the Napoleon apotheosis.
Lincoln is not only our own, but a greater,
purer, sweeter, really stronger man than
Napoleon. It is a good thing to bring
out the little-known portraits of Lincoln.
What a marvelous face! It is full of
strength&mdash;with just enough of the big
child in it to kindle love and sympathy.
Has anyone ever noticed the way in
which Lincoln’s face is cast on the lines
of the North American Indian? We have
never heard that Lincoln had Indian blood
in him; but take any of his good, beardless
portraits, with front or nearly front view;
add to it a shock of straight hair parted
in the middle and falling down, either
straight or in two braids, on the shoulders;
add a feather to it; clothe the body in a
blanket and let it take an Indian stoop;
and no one would question that the man
was an aborigine. The face has the
gravity of the Indian countenance, but
not the impassiveness that we read about;
but Indian faces, after all, are seldom impassive.
The face of Lincoln, who was
not an Indian, has more of the aborigine
in it than of that other great President,
Benito Juarez, who was an Indian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_FAITH_IN_PROVIDENCE">LINCOLN’S FAITH IN PROVIDENCE.</h2>

<p>The raid made by the Confederate general,
J. E. B. Stuart, in June, 1862, around
the Union army commanded by General
McClellan, caused great anxiety in Washington.
One of its results was the interruption
of communication between the
capital and the army of the Potomac.
What this portended no one could affirm.
That it suggested the gravest possibilities
was felt by all.</p>

<p>While this feeling was dominating all
circles, several gentlemen, myself among
them, called on President Lincoln in
order to be definitely advised about the
condition of affairs as understood by him.</p>

<p>To our question: “Mr. President, have
you any news from the army?” he sadly
replied: “Not one word; we can get no
communication with it. I do not know
that we have an army; it may have been
destroyed or captured, though I cannot so
believe, for it was a splendid army. But
the most I can do now is to hope that
serious disaster has not befallen it.”</p>

<p>This led to a somewhat protracted conversation
relative to the general condition
of our affairs. It was useless to talk about
the Army of the Potomac; for we knew
nothing concerning its condition or position
at that moment. The conversation
therefore took a wide range and touched
upon the subject of slavery, about which
much was said.</p>

<p>The President did not participate in this
conversation. He was an attentive listener,
but gave no sign of approval or disapproval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of the views which were expressed.
At length one of the active participants remarked:</p>

<p>“Slavery must be stricken down wherever
it exists in this country. It is right
that it should be. It is a crime against
justice and humanity. We have tolerated
it too long. It brought war upon us.
I believe that Providence is not unmindful
of the struggle in which this nation is engaged.
If we do not do right I believe
God will let us go our own way to our
ruin. But, if we do right, I believe He
will lead us safely out of this wilderness,
crown our arms with victory, and restore
our now dissevered Union.”</p>

<p>I observed President Lincoln closely
while this earnest opinion and expression
of religious faith was being uttered. I
saw that it affected him deeply, and anticipated,
from the play of his features and
the sparkle of his eyes, that he would not
let the occasion pass without making some
definite response to it. I was not mistaken.
Mr. Lincoln had been sitting in
his chair, in a kind of weary and despondent
attitude while the conversation progressed.
At the conclusion of the remarks
I have quoted, he at once arose
and stood at his extreme height. Pausing
a moment, his right arm outstretched towards
the gentleman who had just ceased
speaking, his face aglow like the face of
a prophet, Mr. Lincoln gave deliberate
and emphatic utterance to the religious
faith which sustained him in the great
trial to which he and the country were subjected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
He said: “My faith is greater
than yours. I not only believe that Providence
is not unmindful of the struggle
in which this nation is engaged; that if
we do not do right God will let us go
our own way to our ruin; and that if we
do right He will lead us safely out of this
wilderness, crown our arms with victory,
and restore our dissevered union, as you
have expressed your belief; but I also
believe that He will compel us to do right
in order that He may do these things, not
so much because we desire them as that
they accord with His plans of dealing with
this nation, in the midst of which He
means to establish justice. I think He
means that we shall do more than we have
yet done in furtherance of His plans, and
He will open the way for our doing it.
I have felt His hand upon me in great
trials and submitted to His guidance, and
I trust that as He shall further open the
way I will be ready to walk therein, relying
on His help and trusting in His
goodness and wisdom.”&mdash;From “Some
Memories of Lincoln,” by ex-Senator
James F. Wilson, in North American Review.</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_LAST_WORDS">LINCOLN’S LAST WORDS.</h2>

<p>The very last words Lincoln delivered
on the afternoon before the assassination&mdash;last
of those great utterances that for
six or seven years electrified and enlightened
half the world&mdash;were a message
of suggestion and encouragement to the
miners of the Rockies. Schuyler Colfax
was going thither and was paying his final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
call at the White House. Lincoln said to
him:</p>

<p>“Mr. Colfax, I want you to take a
message from me to the miners whom you
visit. I have very large ideas of the mineral
wealth of our nation. I believe it is
practically inexhaustible. It abounds all
over the western country, from the Rocky
mountains to the Pacific, and its development
has scarcely commenced. During
the war, when we were adding a couple of
million dollars every day to our national
debt, I did not care about encouraging the
increase in the volume of our precious
metals; we had the country to save first.
But now that the rebellion is overthrown,
and we know pretty nearly the amount
of our national debt, the more gold and
silver we mine, we make the payment of
that debt so much easier. Now, I am
going to encourage that in every possible
way. We shall have hundreds of thousands
of disbanded soldiers, and many have
feared that their return home in such
great numbers might paralyze industry
by furnishing suddenly a greater supply of
labor than there will be a demand for. I
am going to try to attract them to the
hidden wealth of our mountain ranges,
where there is room enough for all. Immigration,
which even the war has not
stopped, will land upon our shores hundreds
of thousands more from over-crowded
Europe. I intend to point them
to the gold and silver that wait for them
in the West. Tell the miners for me, that
I shall promote their interests to the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of my ability, because their prosperity is
the prosperity of the nation; and we shall
prove in a few years that we are indeed
the treasury of the world.”</p>

<h2 id="A_CHICAGOAN_WHO_SAW_LINCOLN">A CHICAGOAN WHO SAW LINCOLN
SHOT.</h2>

<p>Mr. George C. Read, of Chicago, at the
time of President Lincoln’s assassination,
was a foot orderly under Generals Griffin
and Ayers. He was in Washington on
the fateful April 14, 1865, and was an eyewitness
to the tragedy. He tells of it as
follows:</p>

<p>“Some time in the latter part of March,
1865, I was sent to Washington on account
of the loss of my voice. I remained there
most of the time in barracks on east Capitol
Hill. On the afternoon of the fated
April 14, 1865, I happened in the saloon
next door to Ford’s Theater to see the
barkeeper, one Jim Peck. While standing
near a stove about the center of the
room three men came into the place
laughing and talking loudly. They all
went to the end of the bar nearest the
door and ordered a drink. One was a tall,
handsome fellow, dressed in the latest
fashionable clothes, if I remember rightly,
and the others appeared like workmen of
some kind. Both were carelessly dressed,
and I think one was in his shirt sleeves.
They had their drink, and then the fine-looking
man turned toward where I was
standing and said, ‘Come up, soldier, and
have a drink.’ I declined, for the reason
that I had not at that time become addicted
to the habit of social drinking. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
then approached me and took me by the
arm and said, ‘Have something; take a
cigar.’ This I did not refuse, and he put
his hand in his vest pocket and, pulling out
a cigar, handed it to me without any further
remarks. He then returned to his
companions at the bar. They remained, if
I remember correctly, about five minutes
after, and then, all laughing at something
that Peck said, left the place. As soon
as they were gone I asked Peck who the
big man was, and he said that he was an
actor&mdash;one of the Booth family&mdash;John
Wilkes Booth. I had heard of him before,
but paid no further attention to it
except to remark that he seemed to be in a
happy frame of mind, when Peck stated
that he was on a ‘drunk,’ and associated
with the stage mechanics in the theater all
the time.</p>

<p>“As I was about to depart, little thinking
what history would develop in a few short
hours, Peck asked me to accept a couple
of tickets to the theater for that night. I
was glad to get them, having no money to
purchase the same, and knowing that the
President would be at the play. Later I
found a young man, like myself, broke, and
invited him to accompany me to the play.
We were on hand early, and, having good
reserved seats about the center of the
house, were elated over our good luck.</p>

<p>“Suffice it to say that the curtain went
up and ‘Our American Cousin’ was introduced.
I was intently interested and
cannot remember positively what act it was
that was on, except what is told in history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
when I heard a shot, and immediately
a man appeared at the front of the
President’s box and, without waiting,
jumped to the stage beneath. I, as well as
all others in the theater, was astonished.
He ran to about the center of the stage
and raised his left hand and said something
I did not catch, and then disappeared behind
the wings. As soon as I saw him I
recognized the handsome man I had seen
in the saloon that afternoon, and turned
to my comrade and said: ‘That’s Wilkes
Booth, the actor, and I think he is on a
drunk.’ Before I had finished even this
a cry went up that the President had been
shot, ‘Stop that man!’ and many other
exclamations I have forgotten. It was all
done so quickly that one had hardly time
to think. Immediately the audience rose
as one person and cries were heard all
over the house, ‘Stop that man!’ ‘The
President has been assassinated!’ and
many others. The people began to crush
each other and try to get out of the theater,
but they were quieted to a certain extent
and the provost guard on duty there
fought to make them keep their places.
Soon there was a movement on the side
aisle running from the President’s box,
and from where I was standing on my
seat I could see what appeared to be a
party of men carrying some one. Later
the rest of the party were conducted out of
the theater, and when I managed to get
outside I saw a crowd looking up at a
house opposite. On asking what it meant,
I was told that the President had been carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
there and was dying. I lost my comrade
in the crowd and have never met him
since.</p>

<p>“It is unnecessary to go into any more
details of what occurred that night. I was
excited, as well as every one else in the
city, and got little rest. But that is my
experience, told as briefly as possible,
without any stretch of imagination. If I
had to do with the same again I think it
would have been better if I had told the
officials what I saw that afternoon, but, as
it was, all came out right, and the really
guilty ones suffered the penalty of their
crime. I met Peck the next year in New
York City, but have never heard of or
seen him since.”</p>

<h2 id="MARTYRED_LINCOLNS_BLOOD">MARTYRED LINCOLN’S BLOOD.</h2>

<p>An interesting and valuable relic, which
brings vividly to the mind the historic
scene in Ford’s Theater, Washington, on
the night of April 14, 1865, is owned by
Colonel James S. Case, at one time a resident
of Philadelphia, but whose home is
now in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>It is only a play bill, but upon it is a
discoloration made by a tiny drop of President
Lincoln’s blood. It was picked up
just after the tragedy by John T. Ford, the
manager of the theater. He found it on
the floor of the box where it had fallen
from the President’s hand when the bullet
of Assassin Booth pierced his head. It
lay beneath the chair in which the citizen-hero
received his death wound. There was
a tiny spot of blood, still red as it came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
from the great heart of Lincoln, on the
edge.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford carried the precious paper
home, and only parted with it at the request
of the late A. K. Browne of Washington,
who was a warm personal friend
of the manager. It came into Mr.
Browne’s possession while the nation was
still mourning for its idol, and soon after
his assassin had met justly merited fate at
the hands of Sergeant Boston Corbett.</p>

<p>The play bill is somewhat yellow from
age, but otherwise in an excellent state of
preservation. The bloodstain is now a
dark brown. The program was of “Our
American Cousin,” which was being given
for the benefit of Laura Keene. The
bloodstain is nearly half way down the
program, opposite the names of John
Dyott, and Harry Hawk, Miss Keene’s
leading support.</p>

<h2 id="A_STRANGE_COINCIDENCE_IN_THE">A STRANGE COINCIDENCE IN THE
LIVES OF LINCOLN AND HIS
SLAYER.</h2>

<p>When President Lincoln was assassinated
on the night of April 14, 1865, while
witnessing a play at Ford’s Theater in
Washington, he was removed to the Peterson
house, which was directly opposite the
theater.</p>

<p>The late John T. Ford related that he
had occasion to visit John Wilkes Booth
at the Peterson house once. The Davenport-Wallack
combination was playing
“Julius Cæsar” at Ford’s theater. Booth
had been cast to play Marc Antony and
was late in coming to rehearsal. Ford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
went over to the house to ask him to hurry
up. He found Booth lying in bed studying
his lines. He little dreamed then that Lincoln
would so shortly die in the same
house, the same room and on that identical
bed, or that Booth would turn out to
be his assassin.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="WHERE_IS_THE_ORIGINAL_EMANCIPATION">WHERE IS THE ORIGINAL EMANCIPATION
PROCLAMATION?</h2>

<p>When Lincoln went to Washington he
had a sale of the furniture of the Eighth
street home at Springfield. Most of the
articles were bought by a well-to-do family
named Tilton, who admired the President
in such a way as to make what had belonged
to him things to be treasured.
When the troops passed through Springfield
to the front they visited the house
“where Uncle Abe had lived,” and the Tiltons
used to confer great favor by permitting
the boys in blue to sit down in the
dining room and have a glass of milk off
the table from which Mr. Lincoln had
eaten many times. But the Tiltons moved
away to Chicago. They carried with them
the furniture which had been in the Lincoln
house, prizing it more than ever after
his death. In 1871 came the Chicago fire,
and with it went not only the Lincoln furniture,
but the original document, which,
if it were in existence now, would be preserved
with the zeal that guards the Declaration
of Independence&mdash;the Proclamation
of Emancipation. The draft of the
proclamation had been sent to Chicago to
be exhibited for some purpose and was
burned in that fire.</p>

<h2 id="MR_GRIFFITHS_ON_LINCOLN">MR. GRIFFITHS ON LINCOLN.</h2>

<p>“No other public man has been subjected
to such scrutiny from the time he
was born until the end of his tragic career
as was Lincoln,” said Mr. Griffiths in a
lecture. “He obtained his early education
from ‘Æsop’s Fables,’ ‘Robinson Crusoe,’
the ‘Pilgrim’s Progress’ and a copy of the
Indiana statutes. This was before some
of our later legislatures had made their
records or his education might have been
marred instead of made.</p>

<p>“When he was elected President,” Mr.
Griffiths continued, “he was a plodding
country lawyer whose library consisted of
twenty-two volumes. Through his public
addresses he blazed his way to the Presidency.
He believed the position of a
stump speaker to be one of sacred trust.
He had none of the platform graces. His
figure was ungainly; his voice was rasping.
He always made the most careful
preparation and gave his best thought to
the smallest audiences. He had marvelous
gift of expression and he knew more about
the Bible than Webster. He was not
learned in the law and he despised the
legal routine. On a lawsuit he always
dealt in the unexpected, which greatly discomfited
the opposing lawyer. He liked
stories, but he always told them to illustrate
a point. He was a deeply religious
man.”</p>

<h2 id="A_FAMOUS_CHICAGO_LAWYERS_VIEWS">A FAMOUS CHICAGO LAWYER’S VIEWS.</h2>

<p>“Into the story of the republic from 1861
to 1865 the patriot does well to enter,
there to find for instruction and example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the manliest of Americans, the highest type
of Americanism, the central figure of the
century, Abraham Lincoln. The fierce
partisanship which assailed him during his
short period of leadership became silent at
his death, and each succeeding year but
serves to exalt his work and character.</p>

<p>“The judgment of time has already
shown to be colossal him who was called
common&mdash;the honor that we offer to his
memory is only the spontaneous tribute of
contemporary history&mdash;our enthusiasm is
but the sum of the world’s calmest thinking.
For years in all lands gifted speech
has proclaimed his deeds and the pens of
poets have sketched his life. Thus does he
receive his tribute from the people.</p>

<p>“In his mentality Lincoln shone in justice,
common sense, consistency, persistence,
and knowledge of men. In his words
he was candid and frank, but accurate and
concise, speaking strong Anglo-Saxon unadorned&mdash;powerful
in its simplicity. In
his sentiments he was kind, patriotic, and
brave. No leader ever combined more
completely the graces of gentleness with
rugged determination. In his morals
truth was his star, honesty the vital essence
of his life.</p>

<p>“In his religion he was faithful as a
saint. Providence was his stay and he
walked with God. As President his life
and deeds were a constant sermon. Love
of men and faith in God were the fundamental
elements of his character. Poverty
had schooled him to pity and taught him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the equality of all mankind.”&mdash;Luther Laflin
Mills.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLN_WAS_PLAIN_BUT_GREAT">LINCOLN WAS PLAIN BUT GREAT.</h2>

<p>Lincoln’s forefathers were independent
owners of the land they trod on, barons,
not serfs. You will say, perhaps, that
Lincoln had little education. We are apt
to say that of our great men. Lincoln
knew how to speak, read and write. What
more do we teach our boys to-day? He
knew the Bible, which cannot be said of
everybody in Boston. He read Burns, and
this with the Bible gave him his inspiration
and sentiment. Æsop and “Pilgrim’s
Progress” taught him aptness and pregnant
illustration.</p>

<p>The incidents of his life were few but
notable. He was a resident of three states
before he was 21, and made a river trip to
New Orleans, longer than Thomas Jefferson
had taken at his age. At New Orleans
he saw for the first time the auction
and whipping of slaves, which made so
deep an impression on him that it may be
said to be the birth of his anti-slavery
sentiment.</p>

<p>The choice of Mr. Lincoln for President
was not a strained one. He was the logical
selection. Lincoln’s qualities, that
sympathy with the common people, that
homely sincerity, have given him a place
in the people’s hearts a little closer, a
little dearer, than is held by any other public
man. He had faults, but they were
small compared with his virtues. He had
not Washington’s grandeur, the mental
alertness of Hamilton, or the intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
force of Webster. His greatness was made
up of natural qualities, as of a hillside towering
o’er a plain, yet a part of it. Lincoln
was surpassed in certain qualities by other
of our historically great men, but there are
none, we feel sure, who would have filled
the place he filled as well as he.&mdash;Secretary
of War Long.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="LINCOLNS_SPECIFIC_LIFE_WORK">LINCOLN’S SPECIFIC LIFE WORK.</h2>

<p>One often thinks of his life as cut off,
but no great man since Cæsar has seen his
life work ended as did Lincoln. Napoleon
died upon a desert rock, but not until Austerlitz
and Wagram had become memories,
and the dust of the empire even as
all dust. Cromwell knew that England
had not at heart materially altered. Washington
did not know that he had created
one of the great, perhaps the greatest, empires
to be known to man. But Lincoln
had a specific task to do&mdash;to save his country
and to make it free&mdash;and on that fateful
14th of April he knew that he had
accomplished both things.</p>

<p>There are those who would say that
chance put this man where he was to do
this work. To the thoughtful mind it was
not chance, however, but design, and that
the design of which all greatness is a part.
War is indeed the crucible of the nations.
It is the student of a century hence who
shall properly place the civil war in American
history. But, whatever that place be,
there can be no doubt of the position in
it of the war President. Like William the
Silent, his domination of all about him
was a matter not of personal desire, but of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
absolute and constant growth. There are
few more interesting characters in history
than Lincoln. There is none who in quite
the same manner fits himself so absolutely
into his circumstances. It is the highest
form of genius that so produces as to
make production seem effortless, and it is
perhaps the greatest of all tributes to Lincoln
that what he did seems sometimes
only what the average man would have
done in his place.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="THE_PROPOSED_PURCHASE_OF_THE">THE PROPOSED PURCHASE OF THE
SLAVES.</h2>

<p>The discussion on the question of
whether or not Abraham Lincoln suggested
at the conference with the southern
commissioners at the so-called Fortress
Monroe meeting, that he was prepared to
pay $400,000,000 for the slaves in the
Southern States provided peace with union
could be obtained, is hardly likely to lead
to any definite conclusion, for the reason
that the few who should have known definitely
about it are distinctly divided in
their opinions. We are inclined to believe
that, if the proposition was made, Mr.
Lincoln, notwithstanding the immense influence
that he then possessed, would have
found it exceedingly difficult to convince
Congress and a majority of the people of
the North of the wisdom of the suggestion.
As a business proposition, entirely apart
from sentiment, it might have been, even
at that late day, a wise plan to adopt.
But the war had then been going on for
years, and the hard feelings engendered
would apparently have made the scheme a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
less tenable one then than at an earlier
day. It will, we imagine, appear to future
historians that, in spite of the example
which had been set by England in the
West Indies, those representing both the
North and the South showed themselves,
just prior to the war, wanting in the true
elements of statesmanship in not realizing
that it was better to peaceably adjust their
differences than have recourse to physical
force. It is now well understood, and
might have been well understood at the
time, that the main issue was the slave
issue, and that once out of the way, all
other sources of division were insignificant.
We could have well afforded to vote, if
need be, several thousands of millions of
dollars to purchase the freedom of the
slaves if by that means the civil war with
all of its wastes and sufferings could have
been avoided; and if not now, a generation
or two hence, we feel convinced that the
people, both of the North and the South,
will be of the opinion that such an outcome
of the contention would have been possible
if we had had on both sides of the
quarrel, statesmen of the caliber of Washington,
Jefferson, Franklin, John Quincy
Adams and other eminent Americans who
have made their mark in our national history.</p>

<h2 id="SENATOR_THURSTONS_SPEECH">SENATOR THURSTON’S SPEECH.</h2>

<p>Senator John M. Thurston said in part
at a banquet of the Baptist Social Union,
New York, on Lincoln’s birthday, in 1897:</p>

<p>“This is an entirely different gathering
than that to which I have been recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
accustomed. I come from a forty days’
session of a moot court, in which the
question of silver has been discussed and
passed upon without any hope of legislation.
There I have been used to having
my audiences rise and leave as soon as I
began to speak.</p>

<p>“Mr. President, if I have any purpose
to-night, it is to strengthen the belief in a
Divine Providence; and if I have any further
purpose in this time of wars and rumors
of wars, it is to show that God Almighty
has made nations for higher purposes
than mere money making. I am to
speak to-night of Abraham Lincoln, the
simplest, serenest, sublimist character of
the age. Seventy millions of people join
in commemorating his greatness. It is
not my purpose to review his life; that is
too much a part of history. That history
should be taught in every American public
school and preached from every Christian
pulpit. The story of Abraham Lincoln,
citizen, President, liberator and martyr,
should be in the heart of every American
child. I prefer to speak of only one event
in his history. Yet that event was the
harbinger of a new civilization.</p>

<p>“Not long since, as I sat in a crowded
court room, engaged in the trial of a case
involving the title to a valuable tract of
real estate, there came to the witness stand
a venerable, white-haired negro. Written
all over his old black face was the history
of three-quarters of a century of such an
existence as few persons have ever known.
Born a slave, he had stood upon the auction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
block and been sold to the highest
bidder; he had seen his wife and children
dragged from his side by those who
mocked his breaking heart; he bore upon
his back the scars and ridges of a master’s
lash. Now he came into a court of justice
to settle, by the testimony of his black lips,
a controversy between white men. When
asked his age he drew himself proudly up
and said: ‘For fifty years I was a chattel.
On the first day of January, 1863, old
Uncle Abe made me a man.’</p>

<p>“The act which set that old man free was
the crowning glory of Lincoln’s life, for
by it he not only saved his country, but
emancipated a race. When Abraham Lincoln
took his pen to sign the Emancipation
Proclamation he knew that the supreme
moment had come. He had known
it years before, when he said: ‘A house
divided against itself cannot stand. I believe
that this government cannot exist
permanently, half slave and half free, but
I do not expect this house to fall, this
government to be dissolved.’</p>

<p>“God has always raised up a great
leader for a great crisis. Moses, initiated
into the sublime mysteries of the house of
Pharaoh, himself a ruler and almost a
king, led the children of Israel through the
parted waters of the Red Seas into the
wilderness in the strange hope of a deliverance.
A shepherdess on the hills of
France felt herself stirred at the sore trials
of her race. Joan d’Arc, the savior of her
country, was the instrument of God.</p>

<p>“Who can doubt that Providence put
the preposterous notion of a round world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
into the head of the Genoese sailor? Who
can doubt that Providence designed
Christopher Columbus, George Washington,
Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S.
Grant each for his own mission? The
Declaration of Independence was the
Genesis of American liberty, but the gospel
of its New Testament was the Emancipation
Proclamation. Until the Emancipation
Proclamation the tide of success
set strongly against the Union shore.
But afterward the soldiers of the Union
marched steadily from Chattanooga to Atlanta
and from Atlanta to the sea. From
the time the flag of liberty became the flag
of freedom and the Stars and Stripes no
longer floated over slaves, the Union
never wavered in its onward march.</p>

<p>“Almost a third of a century has passed
away. Blue and gray they lie together beneath
the sod. Heroes all, they fell face to
face, brother against brother. But through
the mingled tears that fall alike upon the
dead of both sections, the eyes of all turn
toward a new future under the old flag.
To the North and South, to the white and
the black, Abraham Lincoln was God’s
special providence. What is the heritage
to us? In his own words, ‘A government
of the people, by the people, and for the
people.’</p>

<p>“I wish that my voice could reach from
one end of the land to the other while I
tell what true Americanism is. I come
from a State that has as great local necessities,
perhaps, as any other. The State of
Nebraska put one star into the flag. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
great State of New York put another. But
when they set them there, they ceased to
shine for themselves, but for the whole
Union.</p>

<p>“What we need in this country is the
Emancipation Proclamation and the Stars
and Stripes at every polling place. We
need a revival of the American flag. Let
it float over every American battlefield, be
taught in every public school. Set the
Stars of the Union in the hearts of our
children and the glory of the Republic will
remain forever. It does not matter
whether the American cradle is rocked to
the music of ‘Yankee Doodle’ or the lullaby
of ‘Dixie’ if the flag of the nation is
displayed above it, and the American baby
can be safely trusted to pull about the floor
the rusty scabbard and the battered canteen,
whether the inheritance be from blue
or gray, if from the breast of a true mother
and the lips of a brave father, its little soul
is filled with the glory of the American
constellation.</p>

<p>“The memory of Lincoln cannot perish.
On freedom’s roll of honor the name of
Lincoln is written first. His colossal
statue stands on a pedestal of the people’s
love, and in its protecting shadow, liberty
and equality are the heritage of every
American citizen.”</p>

<h2 id="LINCOLN_ANALYZED">LINCOLN ANALYZED.</h2>

<p>There is something in Washington or
in Lincoln or Grant, that defies analysis.
It is a moral elevation, a magnanimity, a
nobleness and profoundness of mind. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
is force of character and ability by which
man is able to meet great emergencies.
This is true greatness.</p>

<p>Nothing discloses real character like the
use of power. If you wish to know what
a man really is, give him power. This is
the supreme test.</p>

<p>Judged by this standard Abraham Lincoln
stands out one of the purest, grandest
and noblest characters of all time.
Greatness was never more unconscious of
itself than it was in him. It consisted in
the fact that he made mistakes but rose
above them.</p>

<p>Lincoln was a man of marvelous
growth. The statesman or the military
hero born and reared in a log cabin is a
familiar figure in American history; but we
may search in vain among our men of
honor and fame for one whose origin and
early life equaled Abraham Lincoln’s in
obscurity and lack of education.</p>

<p>He sprang from the poorest class in the
border south. Hard work his early lot;
his education a minus factor. In the year
of his majority his father moved to Illinois.
Here Lincoln began for himself the
hard battle of life. He became an ambitious
young man. Unquestionably in
some mysterious way, he arrived at the
conclusion that this world had something
far higher for him than neighborhood
joker, champion wrestler or prize wood

<p>A lawyer lent him a copy of Blackstone
and he commenced the study of law; was
admitted to the bar in 1836; rose rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
in his profession and became an eminent
lawyer. Being more adapted to the part
of a jurist than an advocate, owing to the
striking uprightness of his character, he
applied himself to this branch of his profession,
and it may truly be said that his
vivid sense of truth and justice had much
to do with his effectiveness as a jurist.
When he felt himself to be the protector of
innocence, the defender of justice, or the
prosecutor of wrong, he frequently disclosed
such unexpected resources of reasoning,
such depth of feeling, and rose to
such fervor of appeal as to astonish and
overwhelm his hearers, and make his appeal
irresistible.</p>

<p>He continued to “ride the circuit,” read
books, tell funny stories to his fellow lawyers
in the tavern, chat familiarly with his
neighbors and become more and more
widely known, trusted and beloved among
the people of his State for his ability as a
lawyer and politician, for the integrity of
his character and the ever-flowing spring
of sympathetic kindness in his heart. His
main ambition was that of political distinction,
yet no one, at that time, would
have suspected that he was the man destined
to lead the nation through the greatest
crisis of the century.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was growing, indeed,
this is one prominent fact in Lincoln’s life&mdash;he
never ceased growing. As captain in
the Black Hawk war, as candidate for the
legislature, as storekeeper, postmaster,
surveyor and law student, he was always
growing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1846 he was elected to congress
where he distinguished himself as a humorous
speaker and rapidly advanced to the
front as a statesman.</p>

<p>Lincoln was a statesman in the truest
and grandest sense of the word. He was a
type of honesty and moral integrity. He
had a conscience “void of offense toward
God, and toward men.” A lover of the
truth and men learned to trust him. He
was just and for that reason would not
put upon others that which he would not
put upon himself. He studied the questions
of the day and founded his opinions
on truth and justice.</p>

<p>It was not until 1854 when the slavery
question had been thrust into politics as
the paramount issue, that Lincoln’s powers
were aroused to their fullest capacity. He
plunged into arduous study of the question,
in its legal, historical and moral aspects,
until his mind became a complete
arsenal of argument.</p>

<p>Now he was able to cope with any political
antagonist. The time had come when
the Republican party required a man to
put forward as their standard bearer one
who would be equal for the coming election.</p>

<p>They found in Lincoln all the antecedents
of his life to be such as to produce
in him the rarest qualifications for
the Presidency, to which he was now called
by his party. It was during this canvass
that he first revealed, in his great debates
with Stephen A. Douglas, the full scope
of his originality and genius. Subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to this combat of giants, he was duly
elected President.</p>

<p>No President, before or since, ever took
his seat under such difficulties. The situation
which confronted him was appalling;
secession of the Southern States was fully
organized, and less than a month before his
inauguration seven of them had already
seceded.</p>

<p>During his inaugural address he declared
his fixed purpose to uphold the Constitution
and preserve the integrity of the
Union. It was his policy to ignore the
action of the seceded States as a thing in
itself null, void and of no effect.</p>

<p>Lincoln was the man whom Providence
placed at the head of the nation in the supreme
hour of its destiny. When he assumed
the reins of government he was surrounded
by traitors. The government was
without army, without navy, without
credit. He spoke, and two millions of men
sprang, as from the ground. He breathed,
and the bosom of the ocean was covered
with ships of war. He placed his hand upon
Wall street and the credit of the government
was secured. He surrounded
himself with the best and truest counselors
of the time.</p>

<p>He signed his name and the shackles fell
from the limbs of four million of slaves.
His was a greatness for the time. He was
the Moses of a new dispensation&mdash;called of
God to lead the hosts of captives out of
the bondage house of their oppression.
Like his great prototype he was not permitted
to see the land of promise. He led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the people safely through, but he was not
allowed to guide them across the Jordan.</p>

<p>On the morning of April 15, 1865, God
called Abraham Lincoln away from mortal
sight.</p>

<p>Measured by what he did as a statesman
and leader, he stands head and shoulders
above all rulers of men in the annals of the
six thousand years of Human History.</p>

<p>While a “solitary stripe remains in our
banner,” while a “single star is blazoned
on its field of blue,” so long will the deeds,
the heroism and the loyalty of Abraham
Lincoln be told to generations yet unborn.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
